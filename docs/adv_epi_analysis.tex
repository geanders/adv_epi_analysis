This is a the coursebook for the Colorado State University course ERHS 732,
Advanced Epidemiological Analysis. This course provides the opportunity to
implement theoretical expertise through designing and conducting advanced
epidemiologic research analyses and to gain in-depth experience analyzing
datasets from the environmental epidemiology literature. This course will
complement the student's training in advanced epidemiological methods,
leveraging regression approaches and statistical programming, providing the
opportunity to implement their theoretical expertise through designing and
conducting advanced epidemiologic research analyses. During the course,
students will gain in-depth experience analyzing two datasets from the
environmental epidemiology literature---(1) time series data with daily measures
of weather, air pollution, and cardiorespiratory outcomes in London, England and
(2) a dataset with measures from the Framingham Heart Study. Additional datasets
and studies will be discussed and explored as a supplement.

This class will utilize a variety of instructional formats, including short lectures, readings, topic specific examples from the substantive literature, discussion and directed group work on in-course coding exercises putting lecture and discussion content into practice. A variety of teaching modalities will be used, including group discussions, student directed discussions, and in-class group exercises. It is expected that before coming to class, students will read the required papers for the week, as well as any associated code included in the papers' supplemental materials. Students should come to class prepared to do statistical programming (i.e., bring a laptop with statistical software, download any datasets needed for the week etc). Participation is based on in-class coding exercises based on each week's topic. If a student misses a class, they will be expected to complete the in-course exercise outside of class to receive credit for participation in that exercise. Students will be required to do mid-term and final projects which will be presented in class and submitted as a written write-up describing the project.

Prerequisites for this course are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ERHS 534 or ERHS 535 and
\item
  ERHS 640 and
\item
  STAR 511 or STAT 511A or STAT 511B
\end{itemize}

This example dataset shows many characteristics that are common for datasets for
time series studies in environmental epidemiology. Time series data are essentially
a sequence of data points repeatedly taken over a certain time interval (e.g.~day,
week, month etc). General characteristics of time series data for environmental epidemiology studies are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Observations are given at an aggregated level. For example, instead of
  individual observations for each person in London, the \texttt{obs} data give
  counts of deaths throughout London. The level of aggregation is often determined
  by geopolitical boundaries, for example counties of ZIP codes in the US.
\item
  Observations are given at regularly spaced time steps over a period. In the
  \texttt{obs} dataset, the time interval is day. Typically, values will be provided
  continuously over that time period, with observations for each time interval.
  Occasionally, however, the time series data may only be available for
  particular seasons (e.g., only warm season dates for an ozone study), or
  there may be some missing data on either the exposure or health outcome over
  the course of the study period.
\item
  Daily observations are given for the health outcome, for the environmental
  exposure of interest, and for potential time-varying confounders. In the \texttt{obs}
  dataset, the health outcome is mortality (from all causes; sometimes, the health
  outcome will focus on a specific cause of mortality or other health outcomes such
  as hospitalizations or emergency room visits). Counts are given for everyone in
  the city for each day (\texttt{all} column), as well as for specific age categories
  (\texttt{all\_0\_64} for all deaths among those up to 64 years old, and so on). The
  exposure of interest in the \texttt{obs} dataset is temperature, and three metrics of
  this are included (\texttt{tmean}, \texttt{tmin}, and \texttt{tmax}). Day of the week is one
  time-varying factor that could be a confounder, or at least help explain
  variation in the outcome (mortality). This is included through the \texttt{dow} variable
  in the \texttt{obs} data. Sometimes, you will also see a marker for holidays included
  as a potential time-varying confounder, or other exposure variables (temperature
  is a potential confounder, for example, when investigating the relationship
  between air pollution and mortality risk).
\item
  Multiple metrics of an exposure and / or multiple health outcome counts
  may be included for each time step. In the \texttt{obs} example, three metrics of
  temperature are included (minimum daily temperature, maximum daily temperature,
  and mean daily temperature). Several counts of mortality are included, providing
  information for specific age categories in the population.
\end{itemize}

When working with time series data, it is helpful to start with some exploratory
data analysis. The following applied exercise will take you through some of the
questions you might want to answer through this type of exploratory analysis. In
general, the \texttt{lubridate} package is an excellent tool for working with date data
in R (although, in the example code above, we mostly used tools from base R).
You may find it worthwhile to explore this package some more. There is a helpful
chapter in \citet{wickham2016r}, \url{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html}, as well
as a cheatsheet at
\url{https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_lubridate.pdf}. For
visualizations, if you are still learning techniques in R, two books
you may find useful are
\citet{healy2018data} (available online at \url{https://socviz.co/}) and \citet{chang2018r}
(available online at \url{http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/}).

\emph{Applied: Exploring time series data}

Read the example time series data in R and explore it to answer the following
questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the study period for the example \texttt{obs} dataset? (i.e., what
  dates / years are covered by the time series data?)
\item
  Are there any missing dates within this time period?
\item
  Are there seasonal trends in the exposure? In the outcome?
\item
  Are there long-term trends in the exposure? In the outcome?
\item
  Is the outcome associated with day of week? Is the exposure associated
  with day of week?
\end{enumerate}

Based on your exploratory analysis in this section, talk about the potential
for confounding when these data are analyzed to estimate the association between
daily temperature and city-wide mortality. Is confounding by seasonal trends
a concern? How about confounding by long-term trends in exposure and mortality?
How about confounding by day of week?

\emph{Applied exercise: Example code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{What is the study period for the example \texttt{obs} dataset? (i.e., what
  dates / years are covered by the time series data?)}
\end{enumerate}

In the \texttt{obs} dataset, the date of each observation is included in a column called
\texttt{date}. The data type of this column is ``Date''---you can check this by using
the \texttt{class} function from base R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{(obs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "Date"
\end{verbatim}

Since this column has a ``Date'' data type, you can run some mathematical function
calls on it. For example, you can use the \texttt{min} function from base R to get the
earliest date in the dataset and the \texttt{max} function to get the latest.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{min}\NormalTok{(obs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1990-01-01"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{max}\NormalTok{(obs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "2012-08-31"
\end{verbatim}

You can also run the \texttt{range} function to get both the earliest and latest dates
with a single call:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{range}\NormalTok{(obs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1990-01-01" "2012-08-31"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Are there any missing dates within this time period?}
\end{enumerate}

There are a few things you should check to answer this question. First
(and easiest), you can check to see if there are any \texttt{NA} values within
any of the observations in the dataset. The \texttt{summary} function will provide
a summary of the values in each column of the dataset, including the count
of missing values (NAs) if there are any:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(obs)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

Based on this analysis, all observations are complete for all dates included
in the dataset.

However, this does not guarantee that every date between the start date and
end date of the study period are included in the recorded data. Sometimes,
some dates might not get recorded at all in the dataset, and the \texttt{summary}
function won't help you determine when this is the case.

There are a few alternative explorations you can do. First, you can check
the number of days between the start and end date of the study period, and
then see if the number of observations in the dataset is the same:

\begin{Shaded}

  \textbf{Are there seasonal trends in the exposure? In the outcome?}
\end{enumerate}

You can use a simple plot to visualize patterns over time in both the exposure
and the outcome. For example, the following code plots a dot for each daily
temperature observation over the study period. The points are set to a smaller
size (\texttt{size\ =\ 0.5}) and plotted with some transparency (\texttt{alpha\ =\ 0.5}) since
there are so many observations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ date, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ tmean)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{size =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}
There is clear evidence here of a strong seasonal trend in mean temperature,
with values typically lowest in the winter and highest in the summer.

You can plot the outcome variable in the same way:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ date, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ all)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_point}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{size =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-9-1.pdf}

Again, there are seasonal trends, although in this case they are inversed.
Mortality tends to be highest in the winter and lowest in the summer. Further, the
seasonal pattern is not equally strong in all years---some years it has a much
higher winter peak, probably in conjunction with severe influenza seasons.

Another way to look for seasonal trends is with a heatmap-style visualization,
with day of year along the x-axis and year along the y-axis. This allows you
to see patterns that repeat around the same time of the year each year (and
also unusual deviations from normal seaonsal patterns).

For example, here's a plot showing temperature in each year, where the
observations are aligned on the x-axis by time in year. We've reversed
the y-axis so that the earliest years in the study period start at the top
of the visual, then later study years come later---this is a personal style,
and it would be no problem to leave the y-axis as-is. We've used the
\texttt{viridis} color scale for the fill, since that has a number of features
that make it preferable to the default R color scale, including that it
is perceptible for most types of color blindness and be printed out in grayscale
and still be correctly interpreted.

From this visualization, you can see that temperatures tend to be higher in the
summer months and lower in the winter months. ``Spells'' of extreme heat or cold
are visible---where extreme temperatures tend to persist over a period, rather
than randomly fluctuating within a season. You can also see unusual events, like
the extreme heat wave in the summer of 2003, indicated with the brightest
yellow in the plot.

We created the same style of plot for the health outcome. In this case, we
focused on mortality among the oldest age group, as temperature sensitivity
tends to increase with age, so this might be where the strongest patterns are
evident.

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf}

For mortality, there tends to be an increase in the winter compared to the summer.
Some winters have stretches with particularly high mortality---these are likely
a result of seasons with strong influenza outbreaks. You can also see on this
plot the impact of the 2003 heat wave on mortality among this oldest age group.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}

\item
  \textbf{Are there long-term trends in the exposure? In the outcome?}
\end{enumerate}

Some of the plots we created in the last section help in exploring this
question. For example, the following plot shows a clear pattern of decreasing
daily mortality counts, on average, over the course of the study period:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ date, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ all)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-12-1.pdf}

It can be helpful to add a smooth line to help detect these longer-term
patterns, which you can do with \texttt{geom\_smooth}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ date, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ all)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-13-1.pdf}

You could also take the median mortality count across each year in the
study period, although you should take out any years without a full year's
worth of data before you do this, since there are seasonal trends in the
outcome:

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Is the outcome associated with day of week? Is the exposure associated
  with day of week?}
\end{enumerate}

The data already has day of week as a column in the data (\texttt{dow}). However,
this is in a character data type, so it doesn't have the order of weekdays
encoded (e.g., Monday comes before Tuesday). This makes it hard to look for
patterns related to things like weekend / weekday.

We could convert this to a factor and encode the weekday order when we do
it, but it's even easier to just recreate the column from the \texttt{date} column.
We used the \texttt{wday} function from the \texttt{lubridate} package to do this---it extracts
weekday as a factor, with the order of weekdays encoded (using a special
``ordered'' factor type):

Mortality tends to be a bit higher on weekdays than weekends, but it's not
a dramatic difference.

In this case, there does not seem to be much of a pattern by weekday.

\section{Fitting models}\label{fitting-models}}

One of the readings for this week, \citet{vicedo2019hands}, includes a section
on fitting exposure-response functions to describe the association between
daily mean temperature and mortality risk. This article includes example
code in its supplemental material, with code for fitting the model to
these time series data in the file named ``01EstimationERassociation.r''.
The model may at first seem complex, but it is made up of a number of
fairly straightforward pieces (although some may initially seem complex):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The model framework is a \emph{generalized linear model (GLM)}
\item
  This GLM is fit assuming an \emph{error distribution} and a \emph{link function}
  appropriate for count data
\item
  The GLM is fit assuming an \emph{error distribution} that is also appropriate for
  data that may be \emph{overdispersed}
\item
  The model includes control for day of the week by including a \emph{categorical
  variable}
\item
  The model includes control for long-term and seasonal trends by including
  a \emph{spline} (in this case, a \emph{natural cubic spline}) for the day in the study
\item
  The model fits a flexible, non-linear association between temperature
  and mortality risk also using a spline
\item
  The model fits a flexible non-linear association between temperature on
  a series of preceeding days and current day and mortality risk on the
  current day using a \emph{distributed lag approach}
\item
  The model jointly describes both of the two previous non-linear associations
  by fitting these two elements through one construct in the GLM, a
  \emph{cross-basis term}
\end{itemize}

In this section, we will work through the elements, building up the code to
get to the full model that is fit in \citet{vicedo2019hands}.

\emph{Fitting a GLM to time series data}

The GLM framework unites a number of types of regression models you may have
previously worked with. One basic regression model that can be fit within this
framework is a linear regression model. However, the framework also allows you
to also fit, among others, logistic regression models (useful when the outcome
variable can only take one of two values, e.g., success / failure or alive /
dead), Poisson regression models (useful when the outcome variable is a count or
rate).

This generalized framework brings some unity to these different types of
regression models. From a practical standpoint, it has allowed software
developers to easily provide a common interface to fit these types of models.
In R, the common function call to fit GLMs is \texttt{glm}.

Within the GLM framework, the elements that separate different regression models
include the link function and the error distribution. The error distribution
encodes the assumption you are enforcing about how the errors after fitting the
model are distributed. If the outcome data are normally distributed (a.k.a.,
follow a Gaussian distribution), after accounting for variance explained in the
outcome by any of the model covariates, then a linear regression model may be
appropriate. For count data---like numbers of deaths a day---this is unlikely,
unless the average daily mortality count is very high (count data tend to
come closer to a normal distribution the further their average gets from
0). For binary data---like whether each person in a study population died on
a given day or not---normally distributed errors are also unlikely. Instead,
in these two cases, it is typically more appropriate to fit GLMs with
Poisson and binomial ``families'', respectively, where the family designation
includes an appropriate specification for the variance when fitting the model
based on these outcome types.

The other element that distinguishes different types of regression within
the GLM framework is the link function. The link function applies a transformation
on the combination of independent variables in the regression equation
when fitting the model. With normally distributed data, an \emph{identity link}
is often appropriate---with this link, the combination of independent variables
remain unchanged (i.e., keep their initial ``identity''). With count data, a
\emph{log link} is often more appropriate, while with binomial data, a \emph{logit link}
is often used.

Finally, data will often not perfectly adhere to assumptions. For example, the
Poisson family of GLMs assumes that variance follows a Poisson distribution
(The probability mass function for Poisson distribution \(X \sim {\sf Poisson}(\mu)\) is denoted by \(f(k;\mu)=Pr[X=k]= \displaystyle \frac{\mu^{k}e^{-\mu}}{k!}\), where
\(k\) is the number of occurences, and \(\mu\) is equal to the expected number of
cases). With this distribution, the variance is equal to the mean (\(\mu=E(X)=Var(X)\)). With real-life data, this assumption is often not valid, and in many cases the variance in real life count data is larger than the mean. This can be accounted for when fitting a GLM by setting an error distribution that does not require the variance to equal the mean---instead, both a mean value and something like a
variance are estimated from the data, assuming an overdispersion parameter \(\phi\)
so that \(Var(X)=\phi E(X)\). In environmental epidemiology, time series
are often fit to allow for this overdispersion. This is because if the data are overdispersed but the model does not account for this, the standard errors on the
estimates of the model parameters may be artificially small. If the data are not overdispersed (\(\phi=1\)), the model will identify this when being fit to the data,
so it is typically better to prefer to allow for overdispersion in the model
(if the size of the data were small, you may want to be parsimonious and avoid
unneeded complexity in the model, but this is typically not the case with time
series data).

In the next section, you will work through the steps of developing a GLM to fit
the example dataset \texttt{obs}. For now, you will only fit a linear association
between mean daily temperature and mortality risk, eventually including control
for day of week. In later work, especially the next chapter, we will build up
other components of the model, including control for the potential confounders
of long-term and seasonal patterns, as well as advancing the model to fit
non-linear associations, distributed by time, through splines, a distributed lag
approach, and a cross-basis term.

\emph{Applied: Fitting a GLM to time series data}

In R, the function call used to fit GLMs is \texttt{glm}. Most of you have likely
covered GLMs, and ideally this function call, in previous courses. If you are
unfamiliar with its basic use, you will want to refresh yourself on this
topic. {[}Add some online resources that go over basics of GLMs in R.{]}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fit a GLM to estimate the association between mean daily temperature (as the
  independent variable) and daily mortality count (as the dependent variable),
  first fitting a linear regression. (Since the mortality data are counts, we will
  want to shift to a different type of regression within the GLM framework, but
  this step allows you to develop a simple \texttt{glm} call, and to remember where to
  include the data and the independent and dependent variables within this
  function call.)
\item
  Change your function call to fit a regression model in the Poisson family.
\item
  Change your function call to allow for overdispersion in the outcome data
  (daily mortality count). How does the estimated coefficient for temperature
  change between the model fit for \#2 and this model? Check both the central
  estimate and its estimated standard error.
\item
  Change your function call to include control for day of week.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Applied exercise: Example code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Fit a GLM to estimate the association between mean daily temperature (as the
  independent variable) and daily mortality count (as the dependent variable),
  first fitting a linear regression.}
\end{enumerate}

This is the model you are fitting:

\(Y_{t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1_{t}+\epsilon\)

where \(Y_{t}\) is the mortality count on day \(t\), \(X1_{t}\) is the mean temperature
for day \(t\) and \(\epsilon\) is the error term. Since this is a linear model we are
assuming a Gaussian error distribution \(\epsilon \sim {\sf N}(0, \sigma^{2})\),
where \(\sigma^{2}\) is the variance not explained by the covariates (here just
temperature).

To do this, you will use the \texttt{glm} call. If you would like to save model fit
results to use later, you assign the output a name as an R object
(\texttt{mod\_linear\_reg} in the example code). If your study data are in a dataframe,
you can specify these data in the \texttt{glm} call with the \texttt{data} parameter.
Once you do this, you can use column names directly in the model formula.
In the model formula, the dependent variable is specified first (\texttt{all}, the
column for daily mortality counts for all ages, in this example), followed
by a tilde (\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}), followed by all independent variables (only \texttt{tmean} in this
example). If multiple independent variables are included, they are joined using
\texttt{+}---we'll see an example when we start adding control for confounders later.

Once you have fit a model and assigned it to an R object, you can explore it
and use resulting values. First, the print method for a regression model
gives some summary information. This method is automatically called if you
enter the model object's name at the console:

\begin{Shaded}

Make sure you are familiar with the information provided from the model object,
as well as how to interpret values like the coefficient estimates and their
standard errors and p-values. These basic elements should have been covered in
previous coursework (even if a different programming language was used to fit
the model), and so we will not be covering them in great depth here, but instead
focusing on some of the more advanced elements of how regression models are
commonly fit to data from time series and case-crossover study designs in
environmental epidemiology. For a refresher on the basics of fitting
statistical models in R, you may want to check out Chapters 22 through 24 of
\citet{wickham2016r}, a book that is available online.

Finally, there are some newer tools for extracting information from model fit
objects. The \texttt{broom} package extracts different elements from these objects
and returns them in a ``tidy'' data format, which makes it much easier to use
the output further in analysis with functions from the ``tidyverse'' suite of
R packages. These tools are very popular and powerful, and so the \texttt{broom} tools
can be very useful in working with output from regression modeling in R.

The \texttt{broom} package includes three main functions for extracting data from
regression model objects. First, the \texttt{glance} function returns overall data
about the model fit, including the AIC and BIC:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{tidy} function returns data at the level of the model coefficients,
including the estimate for each model parameter, its standard error, test
statistic, and p-value.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

## 2 tmean          -2.37    0.0573     -41.3       0
\end{verbatim}

Finally, the \texttt{augment} function returns data at the level of the original
observations, including the fitted value for each observation, the residual
between the fitted and true value, and some measures of influence on the model
fit.

For more on the \texttt{broom} package, including some excellent examples of how it
can be used to streamline complex regression analyses, see \citet{robinson2014broom}.
There is also a nice example of how it can be used in one of the chapters of
\citet{wickham2016r}, available online at \url{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Change your function call to fit a regression model in the Poisson family.}
\end{enumerate}

A linear regression is often not appropriate when fitting a model where the
outcome variable provides counts, as with the example data. A Poisson regression
is often preferred.

For a count distribution were \(Y \sim {\sf Poisson(\mu)}\) we typically fit a model
such as

\(g(Y)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1\), where \(g()\) represents the link function, in this
case a log function so that \(log(Y)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1\). We can also express
this as \(Y=exp(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1)\).

In the \texttt{glm} call, you can specify this with the \texttt{family}
parameter, for which ``poisson'' is one choice.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod_pois_reg <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{tmean, }\DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ obs, }\DataTypeTok{family =} \StringTok{"poisson"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

One thing to keep in mind with this change is that the model now uses a
non-identity link between the combination of independent variable(s) and the
dependent variable. You will need to keep this in mind when you interpret
the estimates of the regression coefficients. While the coefficient estimate
for \texttt{tmean} from the linear regression could be interpreted as the expected
increase in mortality counts for a one-unit (i.e., one degree Celsius) increase
in temperature, now the estimated coefficient should be interpreted as the
expected increase in the natural log-transform of mortality count for a one-unit
increase in temperature.

You can see this even more clearly if you take a look at the association between
temperature for each observation and the expected mortality count fit by the
model. First, if you look at the fitted values without transforming, they
will still be in a state where mortality count is log-transformed. You can
see by looking at the range of the y-scale that these values are for the log
of expected mortality, rather than expected mortality, and that the fitted
association is linear:

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-30-1.pdf}

You can use exponentiation to transform the fitted values back to just be the
expected mortality count based on the model fit. Once you make this
transformation, you can see how the link in the Poisson family specification
enforced a curved relationship between mean daily temperature and the
untransformed expected mortality count.

  \textbf{Change your function call to allow for overdispersion in the outcome data
  (daily mortality count). How does the estimated coefficient for temperature
  change between the model fit for \#2 and this model? Check both the central
  estimate and its estimated standard error.}
\end{enumerate}

In the R \texttt{glm} call, there is a family that is similar to Poisson (including
using a log link), but that allows for overdispersion. You can specify it
with the ``quasipoisson'' choice for the \texttt{family} parameter in the \texttt{glm} call:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When you use this family, there will be some new information in the summary
for the model object. It will now include a dispersion parameter (\(\phi\)). If this
is close to 1, then the data were close to the assumed variance for a Poisson
distribution (i.e., there was little evidence of overdispersion). In the
example, the overdispersion is around 5, suggesting the data are overdispersed
(this might come down some when we start including independent variables that
explain some of the variation in the outcome variable, like long-term and
seasonal trends).

If you compare the estimates of the temperature coefficient from the Poisson

The central estimate (\texttt{estimate} column) is very similar. However, the estimated
standard error is larger when the model allows for overdispersion. This
indicates that the Poisson model was too simple, and that its inherent
assumption that data were not overdispersed was problematic. If you naively used
a Poisson regression in this case, then you would estimate a confidence
interval on the temperature coefficient that would be too narrow. This could
cause you to conclude that the estimate was statistically significant when
you should not have (although in this case, the estimate is statistically
significant under both models).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Change your function call to include control for day of week.}
\end{enumerate}

Day of week is included in the data as a categorical variable, using a
data type in R called a factor. You are now essentially fitting this model:

\(log(Y)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1+\gamma^{'}X2\),

where \(X2\) is a categorical variable for day of the week and \(\gamma^{'}\)
represents a vector of parameters associated with each category.

It is pretty straightforward to include factors as independent variables in calls
to \texttt{glm}: you just add the column name to the list of other independent variables
with a \texttt{+}. In this case, we need to do one more step: earlier, we added order to
\texttt{dow}, so it would ``remember'' the order of the week days (Monday before Tuesday,
etc.). However, we need to strip off this order before we include the factor in
the \texttt{glm} call. One way to do this is with the \texttt{factor} call, specifying
\texttt{ordered\ =\ FALSE}. Here is the full call to fit this model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod_ctrl_dow <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{tmean }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(dow, }\DataTypeTok{ordered =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{), }

\end{Highlighting}

When you look at the summary for the model object, you can see that the
model has fit a separate model parameter for six of the seven weekdays. The one
weekday that isn't fit (Sunday in this case) serves as a baseline ---these
estimates specify how the log of the expected mortality count is expected to
differ on, for example, Monday versus Sunday (by about 0.03), if the temperature
is the same for the two days.

You can also see from this summary that the coefficients for the day of the
week are all statistically significant. Even though we didn't see a big
difference in mortality counts by day of week in our exploratory analysis,
this suggests that it does help explain some variance in mortality observations
and will likely be worth including in the final model.

The model now includes day of week when fitting an expected mortality count
for each observation. As a result, if you plot fitted values of expected
mortality versus mean daily temperature, you'll see some ``hoppiness'' in the
fitted line:

This is because each fitted value is also incorporating the expected influence
of day of week on the mortality count, and that varies across the observations
(i.e., you could have two days with the same temperature, but different
expected mortality from the model, because they occur on different days).

If you plot the model fits separately for each day of the week, you'll see that
the line is smooth across all observations from the same day of the week:

\emph{Wrapping up}

At this point, the coefficient estimates suggests that risk of mortality
tends to decrease as temperature increases. Do you think this is reasonable?
What else might be important to build into the model based on your analysis

\section{Splines in GLMs}\label{splines-in-glms}}

We saw from the latest model with a linear for mean daily temperature that the
suggested effect on mortality is a decrease in daily mortality counts with
increasing temperature. However, as you've probably guessed that's probably not
entirely accurate. A linear term for the effect of exposure restricts us to an
effect that can be fitted with a straight line (either a null effect or a
monotonically increasing or decreasing effect with increasing exposure).

This clearly is problematic in some cases. One example is when exploring the
association between temperature and health risk. Based on human physiology,
we would expect many health risks to be elevated at temperature extremes,
whether those are extreme cold or extreme heat. A linear term would be
inadequate to describe this kind of U-shaped association. Other effects might
have a threshold---for example, heat stroke might have a very low risk at
most temperatures, only increasing with temperature above a certain threshold.
{[}Maybe add images of these kinds of associations?{]}

We can
capture non-linear patterns in effects, by using different functions of X.
Examples are \(\sqrt{X}\), \(X^{2}\), or more complex smoothing functions, such as
polynomials or splines. Polynomials might at first make a lot of sense,
especially since you've likely come across polynomial terms in mathematics
classes since grade school. However, it turns out that they have some undesirable
properties. A key one is that they can have extreme behavior, particularly
when using a high-order polynomial, and particularly outside the range of
data that are available to fit the model.

An alternative that is generally preferred for environmental epidemiology
studies is the regression spline.
Regression splines are simple parametric smoothing function,
which fit separate polynomial in each interval of the range of the predictor; these
can be linear, quadratic, and cubic. An example of a (in this case cubic) spline
function is \(X+X^{2}+X^{3}+I((X>X_{0})*(X-X_{0})^3)\).This particular function is
a cubic spline with four degrees of freedom (\(df=4\)) and one not (\(X_{0}\)).
A special type of spline called a natural cubic spline is particularly popular.
Unlike a polynomial function, a natural cubic spline ``behaves'' better outside
the range of the data used to fit the model---they are constrained to continue
on a {[}linear?{]} trajectory once they pass beyond the range of the data.
{[}Maybe add more / clarify / add references on the point of why splines versus
polynomials.{]}

Regression splines can be fit in a GLM via the package \texttt{splines}. Two commonly
used examples of regression splines are b-splines and natural cubic
splines. \citet{vicedo2019hands} uses natural cubic splines.

\emph{Applied: Including a spline in a GLM}

For this exercise, you will continue to build up the model that you began in
the examples in the previous chapter. The example uses the data provided with
one of this chapter's readings, \citet{vicedo2019hands}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Start by fitting a somewhat simple model---how are daily mortality counts
  associated with (a) a linear and (b) a non-linear function of time? Is a linear
  term appropriate to describe this association? What types of patterns are
  captured by a non-linear function that are missed by a linear function?
\item
  In the last chapter, the final version of the model used a GLM with an
  overdispersed Poisson distribution, including control for day of week.
  Start from this model and add control for long-term and seasonal trends
  over the study period.
\item
  Refine your model to fit for a non-linear, rather than linear, function
  of temperature in the model. Does a non-linear term seem to be more
  appropriate than a linear term?
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Applied exercise: Example code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Start by fitting a somewhat simple model---how are daily mortality counts
  associated with (a) a linear and (b) a non-linear function of time?}
\end{enumerate}

It is helpful to start by loading the R packages you are likely to need, as
well as the example dataset. You may also need to re-load the example data
and perform the steps taken to clean it in the last chapter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# Load some packages that will likely be useful}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(viridis)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(lubridate)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(broom)}

\CommentTok{# Load and clean the data}
\NormalTok{obs <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{read_csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/lndn_obs.csv"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{dow =} \KeywordTok{wday}\NormalTok{(date, }\DataTypeTok{label =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For this first question, the aim is to model the association between time and
daily mortality counts within the example data. This approach is often used
to explore and, if needed, adjust for temporal factors in the data.

There are a number of factors that can act over time to create patterns in both
environmental exposures and health outcomes. For example, there may be changes
in air pollution exposures over the years of a study because of changes in
regulations or growth or decline of factories and automobile traffic in an area.
Changes in health care and in population demographics can cause patterns in
health outcomes over the study period. At a shorter, seasonal term, there are
also factors that could influence both exposures and outcomes, including
seasonal changes in climate, seasonal changes in emissions, and seasonal
patterns in health outcomes.

It can be difficult to pinpoint and measure these temporal factors, and so
instead a common practice is to include model control based on the time in the
study. This can be measured, for example, as the day since the start of the
study period.

You can easily add a column for day in study for a dataset that
includes date. R saves dates in a special format, which we're using the in
\texttt{obs} dataset:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{(obs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "Date"
\end{verbatim}

However, this is just a fancy overlay on a value that's ultimately saved as
a number. Like most Unix programs, the date is saved as the number of days
since the Unix ``epoch'', January 1, 1970. You can take advantage of this
convention---if you use \texttt{as.numeric} around a date in R, it will give you a
number that gets one unit higher for every new date. Here's the example for
the first date in our example data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{obs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1990-01-01"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(obs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 7305
\end{verbatim}

And here's the example for the next date:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{obs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date[}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1990-01-02"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(obs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{date[}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 7306
\end{verbatim}

You can use this convention to add a column that gives days since the first
study date. While you could also use the \texttt{1:n()} call to get a number for
each row that goes from 1 to the number of rows, that approach would not
catch any ``skips'' in dates in the data (e.g., missing dates if only warm-season
data are included). The use of the dates is more robust:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{obs <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{obs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{time =} \KeywordTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(date) }\OperatorTok{-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{first}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(date)))}

\NormalTok{obs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(date, time)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 8,279 x 2
##    date        time
##    <date>     <dbl>
##  1 1990-01-01     0
##  2 1990-01-02     1
##  3 1990-01-03     2
##  4 1990-01-04     3
##  5 1990-01-05     4
##  6 1990-01-06     5
##  7 1990-01-07     6
##  8 1990-01-08     7
##  9 1990-01-09     8
## 10 1990-01-10     9
## # ... with 8,269 more rows
\end{verbatim}

As a next step, it is always useful to use exploratory data analysis to look
at the patterns that might exist for an association, before you start designing
and fitting the regression model.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-44-1.pdf}

There are clear patterns between time and daily mortality counts in these data.
First, there is a clear long-term pattern, with mortality rates declining on
average over time. Second, there are clear seasonal patterns, with higher
mortality generally in the winter and lower rates in the summer.

To model this, we can start with fitting a linear term. In the last chapter,
we determined that the mortality outcome data can be fit using a GLM with a
Poisson family, allowing for overdispersion as it is common in real-life
count data like these. To include time as a linear term, we can just include
that column name to the right of the \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} in the model formula:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod_time <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{time, }
                \DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ obs, }\DataTypeTok{family =} \StringTok{"quasipoisson"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can use the \texttt{augment} function from the \texttt{broom} package to pull out the
fitted estimate for each of the original observations and plot that, along
with the observed data, to get an idea of what this model has captured:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod_time }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{augment}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-46-1.pdf}
{[}Check for \texttt{termplot}{]}

This linear trend captures the long-term trend in mortality rates fairly well in
this case. This won't always be the case, as there may be some health
outcomes---or some study populations---where the long-term pattern over the
study period might be less linear than in this example. Further, the linear
term is completely unsuccessful in capturing the shorter-term trends in mortality
rate. These oscillate, and so would be impossible to capture over multiple
years with a linear trend.

Instead, it's helpful to use a non-linear term for time in the model. We can
use a natural cubic spline for this, using the \texttt{ns} function from the \texttt{splines}
package. You will need to clarify how flexible the spline function should be,
and this can be specified through the degrees of freedom for the spline. A
spline with more degrees of freedom will be ``wigglier'' over a given data range
compared to a spline with fewer degrees of freedom. Let's start by using
158 degrees of freedom, which translates to about 7 degrees of freedom per year:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(splines)}
\NormalTok{mod_time_nonlin <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{ns}\NormalTok{(time, }\DataTypeTok{df =} \DecValTok{158}\NormalTok{), }
                       \DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ obs, }\DataTypeTok{family =} \StringTok{"quasipoisson"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can visualize the model results in a similar way to how we visualized the
last model. However, there is one extra step. The \texttt{augment} function only
carries through columns in the original data (\texttt{obs}) that were directly used
in fitting the model. Now that we're using a transformation of the \texttt{time}
column, by wrapping it in \texttt{ns}, the \texttt{time} column is no longer included in the
\texttt{augment} output. However, we can easily add it back in using \texttt{mutate},
pulling it from the original \texttt{obs} dataset, and then proceed as before.

The non-linear term for time has allowed enough flexibility that the model now
captures both long-term and seasonal trends in the data.

{[}More on how to pick a good d.f. for an env. epi. model like this{]}. In practice,
researchers often using about 6--8 degrees of freedom per year of the study, in
the case of year-round data. You can explore how changing the degrees of freedom
changes the way the model fits to the observed data. As you use more degrees of
freedom, the line will capture very short-term effects, and may start to
interfere with the shorter-term associations between environmental exposures and
health risk that you are trying to capture. Even in the example model we just
fit, for example, it looks like the control for time may be capturing some
patterns that were likely caused by heatwaves (the rare summer peaks, including
one from the 1995 heatwave). Conversely, if too few degrees of freedom are used,
the model will shift to look much more like the linear model, with inadequate
control for seasonal patterns.

In all cases, when you fit a non-linear function of an explanatory variable,
it will make the model summary results look much more complicated, e.g.:

You can see that there are multiple model coefficients for the variable fit
using a spline function, one less than the number of degrees of freedom. These
model coefficients are very hard to interpret on their own. When we are using
the spline to \emph{control} for a factor that might serve as a confounder of the
association of interest, we typically won't need to try to interpret these
model coefficients---instead, we are interested in accounting for how this
factor explains variability in the outcome, without needing to quantify the
association as a key result. However, there are also cases where we want to
use a spline to fit the association with the exposure that we are interested
in. In this case, we will want to be able to interpret model coefficients from
the spline. Later in this chapter, we will introduce the \texttt{dlnm} package, which
includes functions to both fit and interpret natural cubic splines within
GLMs for environmental epidemiology.

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Start from the last model created in the last chapter and add control for
  long-term and seasonal trends over the study period.}
\end{enumerate}

The last model fit in the last chapter was the following, which fits for the
association between a linear term of temperature and mortality risk, with control
for day of week:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod_ctrl_dow <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{tmean }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{factor}\NormalTok{(dow, }\DataTypeTok{ordered =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{), }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To add control for long-term and seasonal trends, you can take the natural cubic
spline function of temperature that you just fit and include it among the
explanatory / independent variables from the model in the last chapter. If you
want to control for only long-term trends, a linear term of the \texttt{time} column
could work, as we discovered in the first part of this chapter's exercise.
However, seasonal trends could certainly confound the association of interest.
Mortality rates have a clear seasonal pattern, and temperature does as well,
and these patterns create the potential for confounding when we look at how
temperature and mortality risk are associated, beyond any seasonally-driven
pathways.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can see the influence of this seasonal confounding if you look at the model
results. When we look at the results from the model that did not control for
long-term and seasonal trends, we get an estimate that mortality rates tend to
be lower on days with higher temperature, with a negative term for \texttt{tmean}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod_ctrl_dow }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{tidy}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

## 1 tmean  -0.0148  0.000354     -41.7       0
\end{verbatim}

Conversely, when we include control for long-term and seasonal trends, the
estimated association between mortality rates and temperature is reversed,
estimating increased mortality rates on days with higher temperature, \emph{controlling
for long-term and seasonal trends}:

\item
  \textbf{Refine your model to fit for a non-linear, rather than linear, function
  of temperature in the model.}
\end{enumerate}

You can use a spline in the same way to fit a non-linear function for the
exposure of interest in the model (temperature). We'll start there. However,
as mentioned earlier, it's a bit tricky to interpret the coefficients from the
fit model---you no longer generate a single coefficient for the exposure of
interest, but instead several related to the spline. Therefore, once we show
how to fit using \texttt{ns} directly, we'll show how you can do the same thing using
specialized functions in the \texttt{dlnm} package. This package includes a lot of
nice functions for not only fitting an association using a non-linear term,
but also for interpreting the results after the model is fit.

First, here is code that can be used to fit the model using \texttt{ns} directly,
similarly to the approach we used to control for temporal patterns with a
flexible function:

  One important difference compared to a time-series dataset is the \texttt{RANDID} variable. This is the unique identifier for unit for which we have repeated observations for over time.
  In this case the \texttt{RANDID} variable represents a unique identifier for each study participant, with multiple observations (rows) per participant over time.
\item
  The \texttt{TIME} variable indicates the number of days that have ellapsed since beginning of follow-up of each observation. (\texttt{TIME=0} for the first observation of each participant).
\item
  Number of observations varies between participants (typical)
\item
  The time spacing between observations is not constant. This is because the repeated observations in the Framingham Heart Study are the result of follow-up exams happening 3 to 5 years apart. Many longitudinal cohorts will instead have observations over a fixed time interval (monthly, annual, biannual etc), resulting in a more balanced dataset.
\item
  Observations are given for various risk factors, covariates and cardiovascular outcomes. Some will be invariant for each participant over time (\texttt{SEX}, \texttt{educ}), while others will vary with each exam.
\end{itemize}

From a data management perspective, we might want to change all the column names
to be in lowercase, rather than uppercase. This will save our pinkies some
work as we code with the data! You can make that change with the following
code, using the \texttt{str\_to\_lower} function from the \texttt{stringr} package (part of
the \texttt{tidyverse}):

\emph{Applied exercise: Exploring longitudinal cohort data}
Read the example cohort data in R and explore it to answer the following
questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the number of participants and number of observations in the \texttt{fhs} dataset?
\item
  Is there any missingness in the data?
\item
  How many participants die? What is the distribution of age at time of death?
\item
  What is the distribution of age at time of incident MI? Are there differences between males and females? Are there differences in smoking between males and females?
\item
  What is the distribution of BMI among MI cases and non-cases? How about between smokers and non-smokers
\end{enumerate}

Based on this exploratory exercise in this section, talk about the potential
for confounding when these data are analyzed to estimate the association between
smoking and risk of incident MI.

\emph{Applied exercise: Example code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{What is the number of participants and the number of observations in the \texttt{fhs} dataset? (i.e what is the sample size and number of person-time observations)}
\end{enumerate}

In the \texttt{fhs} dataset, the number of participants will be equal to the number of unique ID's (The \texttt{RANDID} variable which takes a unique value for each participant). We can extract this using the \texttt{unique} function nested within the \texttt{length} function

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{length}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{unique}\NormalTok{(fhs}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{randid))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4434
\end{verbatim}

If you'd like to use \texttt{tidyverse} tools to answer this question, you can do
that, as well. The pipe operator (\texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}) works on any type of object---it will
take your current output and include it as the first parameter value for the
function call you pipe into. If you want to perform operations on a column of
a dataframe, you can use \texttt{pull} to extract it from the dataframe as a vector, and
then pipe that into vector operations:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{pull}\NormalTok{(randid) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{unique}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{length}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4434
\end{verbatim}

It's entirely a personal choice whether you use the \texttt{\$} operator and ``nesting''
of function calls, versus \texttt{pull} and piping to do a series of function calls.
You can see you get the same result, so it just comes down to the style that
you will find easiest to understand when you look at your code later.

The number of person-time observations will actually be equal to the length of the dataset.
The \texttt{dim} function gives us the length (number of rows) and width (number of columns) for a dataframe or any matrix like object in R.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{dim}\NormalTok{(fhs)}
\end{Highlighting}

We see that there is approximately an average of 2 to 3 observations per participants.

When you know there are repeated measurements, it can be helpful to explore
how much variation there is in the number of observations per study subject.
You could do that in this dataset with the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\StringTok{  }\CommentTok{# Group by the study subject identifier and then count the rows for each}

\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{desc}\NormalTok{(n)) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{head}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

You can visualize this, as well. A histogram is one good choice:

\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-69-1.pdf}
All study subjects have between one and three measurements. Most of the study
subjects (over 3,000) have three measurements recorded in the dataset.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Is there any missingness in the data?}
\end{enumerate}

We can check for missingness in a number of ways. There are a couple of great
packages, \texttt{visdat} and \texttt{naniar}, that include functions for investigating
missingness in a dataset. If you don't have these installed, you can install
them using \texttt{install.packages("naniar")} and \texttt{install.packages("visdat")}. The
\texttt{naniar} package has \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naniar/vignettes/getting-started-w-naniar.html}{a vignette with
examples}
that is a nice starting point for working with both packages.

The \texttt{vis\_miss} function shows missingness in a dataset in a way that lets you
get a top-level snapshot:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(visdat)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Warning: package 'visdat' was built under R version 4.0.2
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{vis_miss}\NormalTok{(fhs)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-70-1.pdf}
Another was to visualize this is with \texttt{gg\_miss\_var}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(naniar)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Warning: package 'naniar' was built under R version 4.0.2

\begin{Shaded}

\KeywordTok{gg_miss_var}\NormalTok{(fhs)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-71-1.pdf}

Many of the variables are available for all observations, with no missingness,
including records of the subject's ID, measures of death, stroke, CVD, and other
events, age, sex, and BMI. Some of the measured values from visits are missing
occasionally, like the total cholesterol, and glucose. Other measures asked of
the participants (number of cigarettes per day, education) are occasionally
missing. Two of the variables---\texttt{hdlc} and \texttt{ldlc}---are missing more often than
they are available.

You can also do faceting with the \texttt{gg\_miss\_var} function. For
example, you could see if missingness varies by the period of the observation:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{gg_miss_var}\NormalTok{(fhs, }\DataTypeTok{facet =}\NormalTok{ period)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-72-1.pdf}

You may also want to check if missingness varies with whether an observation
was associated with death of the study subject:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{gg_miss_var}\NormalTok{(fhs, }\DataTypeTok{facet =}\NormalTok{ death)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-73-1.pdf}

There are also functions in these packages that allow you to look at how
missingness is related across variables. For example, both \texttt{glucose} and
\texttt{totchol} are continuous variables, and both are occasionally missing. You
can use the geom function \texttt{geom\_miss\_point} from the \texttt{nanair} package
with a ggplot object to explore patterns of missingness among these two
variables:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ glucose, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ totchol)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_miss_point}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-74-1.pdf}

The lower left corner shows the observations where both values are missing---it
looks like there aren't too many. For observations with one missing but not the
other (the points in red along the x- and y-axes), it looks like the distribution
across the non-missing variable is pretty similar to that for observations
with both measurements avaiable. In other words, \texttt{totchol} has a similar
distribution among observations where \texttt{glucose} is available as observations
where \texttt{glucose} is missing.

You can also do things like facet by sex to explore patterns at a finer level:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ glucose, }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ totchol)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_miss_point}\NormalTok{() }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{facet_wrap}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{~}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{sex)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{How many participants die? What is the distribution of age at time of death?}
\end{enumerate}

The \texttt{death} variable in the \texttt{fhs} data is an indicator for mortality if a participant died at any point during follow-up. It is time-invariant taking the value 1 if a participant died at any point or 0 if they were alive at their end of follow-up, so we have to be careful on how to extract the actual number of deaths.

If you arrange by the random ID and look at \texttt{period} and \texttt{death} for each subject,
you can see that the \texttt{death} variable is the same for all periods for each
subject:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

## 10  11252      1     0
## # ... with 11,617 more rows
\end{verbatim}

We need to think some about this convention of recording the data when we count
the deaths.

It is often useful to extract the first (and sometimes last) observation, in order to assess certain covariate statistics on the individual level. We can create a dataset including only the first (or last) observation per participant from the \texttt{fhs} data using \texttt{tidyverse} tools. The \texttt{group\_by} functions groups data by unique values of designated variables (here \texttt{randid}) and the \texttt{slice} function selects rows as designated.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs_first <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{fhs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(randid) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{slice}\NormalTok{(1L)}\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\KeywordTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Alternatively you can use the \texttt{slice\_head} function, which allows us to slice a designated number of rows beginning from the first observation. Because we are piping this in the \texttt{group\_by} function, we will be slicing rows beginning from the first observation for each \texttt{randid}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs_first <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{fhs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(randid) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{slice_head}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{n=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\KeywordTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can similarly select the last observation for each participant

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs_last <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{fhs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(randid) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{slice}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{n}\NormalTok{())}\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\KeywordTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or using the \texttt{slice\_tail} function

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs_last <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{fhs }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(randid) }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{slice_tail}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{n=}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)}\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\KeywordTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this dataset we can extract statistics on baseline covariates on the individual level, but also assess the number of participants with specific values, including \texttt{death=1}. For example, we can use the \texttt{sum} function in base R, which generates the sum of all values for a given vector. In this case since each death has the value of 1 the \texttt{sum} function will give as the number of deaths in the sample.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(fhs_first}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{death) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 1550
\end{verbatim}

Conversely using \texttt{tidyverse} tools we can extract the number of observations with \texttt{death=1} using the \texttt{count} function

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs_first }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\KeywordTok{count}\NormalTok{(death) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   death     n
##   <dbl> <int>
## 1     0  2884
## 2     1  1550
\end{verbatim}

Note that survival or time-to-event outcomes in longitudinal cohort data will often be time-varying. For example, a variable for mortality will take the value of zero until the person-time observation that represents the time interval that the outcome actually happens in. For outcomes such as mortality this will typically be the last observation. We will construct a variable like this in \texttt{fhs} below.

In order to estimate the distribution of age at death among those participants who died during follow-up we need to create a new age at death variable. The \texttt{age} variable in \texttt{fhs} represents the participants age at each visit. Typically a death would happen between visits so the last recorded value for \texttt{age} would be less than the age at death. We will use the \texttt{timedth} variable to help us determine the actual age at death. The value of \texttt{timedth} is the number of days from beginning of follow-up until death for those with \texttt{death=1}, while it is a fixed value of \texttt{timedth=8766} (the maximum duration of follow-up) for those with \texttt{death=0}.

We can create a new age at death variable for those with \texttt{death=1} using the \texttt{age} at baseline and \texttt{timedth} values

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs_first<-fhs_first }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }
\KeywordTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{agedth=}\NormalTok{age}\OperatorTok{+}\NormalTok{timedth}\OperatorTok{/}\FloatTok{365.25}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can then get summary statistics on this new variable

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs_first }\OperatorTok{%>%}\StringTok{ }

\section{Coding a survival analysis}\label{coding-a-survival-analysis}}

In the context of survival analysis what is modelled is time to an event (also referred to as survival time or failure time). This is a bit different than the models in the linear or \texttt{glm} family that model an outcome that may follow a gaussian (linear regression), binomial (logistic model) or Poisson distribution. Another difference is that the outcome (time to event) will not be determined in some participants, as they will not have experienced the event of interest during their follow-up. These participants are considered `censored'. Censoring can occur in three ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item the participant does not experience the event of interest before the study end
\item the participant is lossed to follow-up before experiencing the event of interest
\item the participant experiences a difference event that makes the event of interest impossible (for example if the event of interest is acute MI a participants that dies from a different cause is considered censored)
\end{itemize}

These are all types of right censoring and in simple survival analysis they are considered to be uninformative (typically not related to exposure). If the censoring is related to the exposure and the outcome then adjustment for censoring has to happen.

Let's assume that we are interested in all cause mortality as the event of interest let's denote \(T\) is time to death and \(T\geq 0\). We define the survival function as
\(S(t)=Pr[T>t]=1-F(t)\), where the survival function \(S(t)\) is the probability that a participant survives past time \(t\) (\(Pr[T>t]=1\)). \(F(t)\) is the Probability Density Function, (sometimes also denoted as the the Cumulative Incidence Function, \(R(t)\)) or the probability that that an individual will have a survival time less than or equal to t (\([Pr(T≤t)]\))

Time to event \(t\) is bounded by \([0,\infty)\) and \(S(t)\) is non-increasing as \(t\) becomes greater. At \(t=0\), \(S(t)=1\) and conversely as \(t\) approaches \(\infty\), \(S(t)=0\). A property of the survival and probabilty density function is \(S(t) = 1 – F(t)\): the survival function and the probability density function (or cumulative incidence function (\(R(t)\)) sum to 1.

Another useful function is the hazard Function, \(h(t)\), which is the instantaneous potential of experiencing an event at time \(t\), conditional on having survived to that time (\(h(t)=\frac{Pr[t<T\leq t+\Delta t|T>t]}{\Delta t}=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\)). The cumulative Hazard Function, \(H(t)\) is defined as the integral of the hazard function from time \(0\) to time \(t\), which equals the area under the curve \(h(t)\) between time \(0\) and time \(t\) (\(H(t)=\int_{0}^{t}h(u)du\)).
If we know any of \(S(t)\), \(H(t)\) or \(h(t)\), we can derive the rest based on the following relationships:

\(h(t)=\frac{\partial log(S(t))}{\partial t}\)

\(H(t)=-log(S(t))\) and conversely \(S(t)=exp(-H(t))\)

The \texttt{survival} package in R allows us to fit these types of models, including a very popular model in survival analysis, the Cox proportional hazards model that was also applied in \citet{wong1989risk}.

The Cox proportional hazards model in a simple form has this form

\(log(\lambda(t|X))=log(\lambda_{0}(t))+\beta_{1}\times X\)

where \(\lambda(t)\) represent the hazard at time \(t\), \(\lambda_{0}(t)\) is the baseline hazard at time \(t\), and \(\beta_{1}\) is the log hazard for those with \(X=1\) compared to \(X=0\). The baseline hazard \(\lambda_{0}(t)\) is similar to the intercept term in a linear model or glm and is the value of the hazard when all covariates equal 0. However, unlike the intercept term in a linear model or glm, \(\lambda_{0}(t)\) is not estimated by the model.
The above model can also be writen as

\(\lambda(t|X)=\lambda_{0}(t)\times e^{\beta_{1}\times X}\)

\(e^{\beta_{1}}\) is the hazard ratio comparing those hose with \(X=1\) and \(X=0\)

Using the \texttt{fhs} data we will fit a simple Cox proportianal hazard for the effect of smoking on the hazard for MI.
