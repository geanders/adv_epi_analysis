\chapter{Course information}\label{courseinfo}}

This is a the coursebook for the Colorado State University course ERHS 732,
Advanced Epidemiological Analysis. This course provides the opportunity to
implement theoretical expertise through designing and conducting advanced
epidemiologic research analyses and to gain in-depth experience analyzing
datasets from the environmental epidemiology literature. This course will
complement the student's training in advanced epidemiological methods,
leveraging regression approaches and statistical programming, providing the
opportunity to implement their theoretical expertise through designing and
conducting advanced epidemiologic research analyses. Although basic theoretical frameworks behind analysis and statistical modeling approaches will be introduced, this course will not go into depth into statistical and epidemiologic theory and students are expected to be familiar with general epidemiologic concepts such as confounding, selection bias etc. During the course,
students will gain in-depth experience analyzing two datasets from the
environmental epidemiology literature---(1) time series data with daily measures
of weather, air pollution, and cardiorespiratory outcomes in London, England and
(2) a dataset with measures from the Framingham Heart Study. Additional datasets
and studies will be discussed and explored as a supplement.

This class will utilize a variety of instructional formats, including short lectures, readings, topic specific examples from the substantive literature, discussion and directed group work on in-course coding exercises putting lecture and discussion content into practice. A variety of teaching modalities will be used, including group discussions, student directed discussions, and in-class group exercises. It is expected that before coming to class, students will read the required papers for the week, as well as any associated code included in the papers' supplemental materials. Students should come to class prepared to do statistical programming (i.e., bring a laptop with statistical software, download any datasets needed for the week etc). Participation is based on in-class coding exercises based on each week's topic. If a student misses a class, they will be expected to complete the in-course exercise outside of class to receive credit for participation in that exercise. Students will be required to do mid-term and final projects which will be presented in class and submitted as a written write-up describing the project.

\hypertarget{course-learning-objectives}{%

\hypertarget{prerequisites-and-preparation}{%
\section{Prerequisites and Preparation}\label{prerequisites-and-preparation}}

This course assumes experience in epidemiology and some experience
programming in statistical programming (e.g., R, SAS) and statistics.
Students should have taken (1) Epidemiologic Methods (ERHS 532/PBHL 570),
(2) Advanced Epidemiology (ERHS 640),
(3) R Programming for Research (ERHS 535) or\\
SAS and Epidemiologic Data Management (ERHS 534),
and (4) Design and Data Analysis for Researchers I (STAT 511),
or equivalent courses or experience, prior
to taking this course. While previous SAS experience is acceptable for the
course, example code will be in R, so you will find it helpful to review the basics of R
prior to class.

If you would like to prepare for this course, the best way is by reviewing
R programming, epidemiology, and regression modeling. In each chapter of the book,
we provide the required and supplemental reading for the week. If you need a review
in any of these topics, we recommend starting with the papers and book chapters
listed as general reviews of these topics in the chapters' supplemental reading
sections.

\hypertarget{time-series-case-crossover-studies}{%
\chapter{Time series / case-crossover studies}\label{time-series-case-crossover-studies}}

We'll start by exploring common characteristics in time series data for
environmental epidemiology. In the first have of the class, we're
focusing on a very specific type of study---one that leverages large-scale
vital statistics data, collected at a regular time scale (e.g., daily),
combined with large-scale measurements of a climate-related exposure, with
the goal of estimating the typical relationship between the level of the
exposure and risk of a health outcome. For example, we may have daily
measurements of particulate matter pollution for a city, measured daily at a set
of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors. We want to investigate
how risk of cardiovascular mortality changes in the city from day to day
in association with these pollution levels. If we have daily counts of the
number of cardiovascular deaths in the city, we can create a statistical
model that fits the exposure-response association between particulate matter
concentration and daily risk of cardiovascular mortality. These statistical
models---and the type of data used to fit them---will be the focus of the
first part of this course.

\hypertarget{readings}{%
\section{Readings}\label{readings}}

The required readings for this chapter are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\hypertarget{time-series-and-case-crossover-study-designs}{%
\section{Time series and case-crossover study designs}\label{time-series-and-case-crossover-study-designs}}

In the first half of this course, we'll take a deep look at how researchers
can study how environmental exposures and health risk are linked using
\emph{time series studies}. Let's start by exploring the study design for this type
of study, as well as a closely linked study design, that of \emph{case-crossover
studies}.

It's important to clarify the vocabulary we're using here. We'll use the terms
\emph{time series study} and \emph{case-crossover study} to refer specifically to a type
of study common for studying air pollution and other climate-related exposures.
However, both terms have broader definitions, particularly in fields outside
environmental epidemiology. For example, a \emph{time series study} more generally
refers to a study where data is available for the same unit (e.g., a city)
for multiple time points, typically at regularly-spaced times (e.g., daily).
A variety of statistical methods have been developed to apply to gain insight
from this type of data, some of which are currently rarely used in the specific
fields of air pollution and climate epidemiology that we'll explore here. For
example, there are methods to address autocorrelation over time in
measurements---that is, that measurements taken at closer time points are likely
somewhat correlated---that we won't cover here and that you won't see applied
often in environmental epidemiology studies, but that might be the focus of
a ``Time Series'' course in a statistics or economics department.

In air pollution and climate epidemiology, time series studies typically begin
with study data collected for an aggregated area (e.g., city, county, ZIP code)
and with a daily resolution. These data are usually secondary data, originally
collected by the government or other organizations through vital statistics
or other medical records (for the health data) and networks of monitors for
the exposure data. In the next section of this chapter, we'll explore common
characteristics of these data. These data are used in a time series study to
investigate how changes in the daily level of the exposure is associated with
risk of a health outcome, focusing on the short-term period. For example, a
study might investigate how risk of respiratory hospitalization in a city
changes in relationship with the concentration of particulate matter during the
week or two following exposure. The study period for these studies is often
very long (often a decade or longer), and while single-community time series
studies can be conducted, many time series studies for environmental epidemiology
now include a large set of communities of national or international scope.

The study design essentially compares a community with itself at different time
points---asking if health risk tends to be higher on days when exposure is higher.
By comparing the community to itself, the design removes many challenges that would
come up when comparing one community to another (e.g., is respiratory hospitalization
risk higher in city A than city B because particulate matter concentrations are
typically higher in city A?). Communities differ in demographics and other factors
that influence health risk, and it can be hard to properly control for these when
exploring the role of environmental exposures. By comparison, demographics tend to
change slowly over time (at least, compared to a daily scale) within a community.

One limitation, however, is that the study design is often best-suited to study
acute effects, but more limited in studying chronic health effects. This is tied
to the design and traditional ways of statistically modeling the resulting
data. Since a community is compared with itself, the design removes challenges in
comparing across communities, but it introduces new ones in comparing across time.
Both environmental exposures and rates of health outcomes can have strong
patterns over time, both across the year (e.g., mortality rates tend to follow
a strong seasonal pattern, with higher rates in winter) and across longer periods
(e.g., over the decade or longer of a study period). These patterns must be
addressed through the statistical model fit to the time series data, and they
make it hard to disentangle chronic effects of the exposure from unrelated
temporal patterns in the exposure and outcome, and so most time series studies
will focus on the short-term (or acute) association between exposure and outcome,
typically looking at a period of at most about a month following exposure.

The term \emph{case-crossover study} is a bit more specific than \emph{time series study},
although there has been a strong movement in environmental epidemiology towards
applying a specific version of the design, and so in this field the term often
now implies this more specific version of the design. Broadly, a case-crossover
study is one in which the conditions at the time of a health outcome are compared
to conditions at other times that should otherwise (i.e., outside of the exposure
of interest) be comparable. A case-crossover study could, for example, investigate
the association between weather and car accidents by taking a set of car accidents
and investigating how weather during the car accident compared to weather in the
same location the week before.

One choice in a case-crossover study design is how to select the control time
periods. Early studies tended to use a simple method for this---for example, taking
the day before, or a day the week before, or some similar period somewhat
close to the day of the outcome. As researchers applied the study design to large
sets of data (e.g., all deaths in a community over multiple years), they noticed
that some choices could create bias in estimates. As a result, most environmental
epidemiology case-crossover studies now use a \emph{time-stratified} approach to selecting
control days. This selects a set of control days that typically include days both
before and after the day of the health outcome, and are a defined set of days
within a ``stratum'' that should be comparable in terms of temporal trends. For
daily-resolved data, this stratum typically will include all the days within
a month, year, and day of week. For example, one stratum of comparable days might
be all the Mondays in January of 2010. These stratums are created throughout the
study period, and then days are only compared to other days within their stratum
(although, fortunately, there are ways you can apply a single statistical model
to fit all the data for this approach rather than having to fit code
stratum-by-stratum over many years).

When this is applied to data at an aggregated level (e.g., city, county, or ZIP
code), it is in spirit very similar to a time series study design, in that you
are comparing a community to itself at different time points. The main
difference is that a time series study uses statistical modeling to control from
potential confounding from temporal patterns, while a case-crossover study of
this type instead controls for this potential confounding by only comparing days
that should be ``comparable'' in terms of temporal trends, for example, comparing
a day only to other days in the same month, year, and day of week. You will
often hear that case-crossover studies therefore address potential confounding
for temporal patterns ``by design'' rather than ``statistically'' (as in time series
studies). However, in practice (and as we'll explore in this class), in
environmental epidemiology, case-crossover studies often are applied to
aggregated community-level data, rather than individual-level data, with exposure
assumed to be the same for everyone in the community on a given day. Under these
assumptions, time series and case-crossover studies have been determined to
be essentially equivalent (and, in fact, can use the same study data), only with
slightly different terms used to control for temporal patterns in the statistical
model fit to the data. Several interesting papers have been written to explore
differences and similarities in these two study designs as applied in environmental
epidemiology \citep{basu2005temperature, armstrong2014conditional, lu2007equivalence}.

These types of study designs in practice use similar datasets. In earlier
presentations of the case-crossover design, these data would be set up a bit
differently for statistical modeling. More recent work, however, has clarified
how they can be modeled similarly to when using a time series study design,
allowing the data to be set up in a similar way \citep{armstrong2014conditional}.

Several excellent commentaries or reviews are available that provide more
details on these two study designs and how they have been used specifically
investigate the relationship between climate-related exposures and health \citep{bhaskaran2013time, armstrong2006models, gasparrini2010time}.
Further, these designs are just two tools in a wider collection of study designs
that can be used to explore the health effects of climate-related exposures.
\citet{dominici2008statistical1} provides a nice overview of this broader set of designs.

\section{Time series data}\label{time-series-data}}

Let's explore the type of dataset that can be used for these
time series--style studies in environmental epidemiology. In the examples
in this chapter, we'll be using data that comes as part of the Supplemental
Material in one of this chapter's required readings, \citep{vicedo2019hands}.
Follow the link for the supplement for this article and then look for the
file ``lndn\_obs.csv''. This is the file we'll use as the example data in this
chapter.

These data are saved in a csv format (that is, a plain text file, with commas
used as the delimiter), and so they can be read into R using the \texttt{read\_csv}
function from the \texttt{readr} package (part of the tidyverse). For example, you can
use the following code to read in these data, assuming you have saved them in a
``data'' subdirectory of your current working directory:

This example dataset shows many characteristics that are common for datasets for
time series studies in environmental epidemiology. Time series data are essentially
a sequence of data points repeatedly taken over a certain time interval (e.g., day,
week, month etc). General characteristics of time series data for environmental epidemiology studies are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Observations are given at an aggregated level. For example, instead of
  individual observations for each person in London, the \texttt{obs} data give
  counts of deaths throughout London. The level of aggregation is often determined
  by geopolitical boundaries, for example, counties or ZIP codes in the US.
\item
  Observations are given at regularly spaced time steps over a period. In the
  \texttt{obs} dataset, the time interval is day. Typically, values will be provided
  continuously over that time period, with observations for each time interval.
  Occasionally, however, the time series data may only be available for
  particular seasons (e.g., only warm season dates for an ozone study), or
  there may be some missing data on either the exposure or health outcome over
  the course of the study period.
\item
  Observations are available at the same time step (e.g., daily) for (1) the health outcome, (2) the environmental
  exposure of interest, and (3) potential time-varying confounders. In the \texttt{obs}
  dataset, the health outcome is mortality (from all causes; sometimes, the health
  outcome will focus on a specific cause of mortality or other health outcomes such
  as hospitalizations or emergency room visits). Counts are given for everyone in
  the city for each day (\texttt{all} column), as well as for specific age categories
  (\texttt{all\_0\_64} for all deaths among those up to 64 years old, and so on). The
  exposure of interest in the \texttt{obs} dataset is temperature, and three metrics of
  this are included (\texttt{tmean}, \texttt{tmin}, and \texttt{tmax}). Day of the week is one
  time-varying factor that could be a confounder, or at least help explain
  variation in the outcome (mortality). This is included through the \texttt{dow} variable
  in the \texttt{obs} data. Sometimes, you will also see a marker for holidays included
  as a potential time-varying confounder, or other exposure variables (temperature
  is a potential confounder, for example, when investigating the relationship
  between air pollution and mortality risk).
\item
  Multiple metrics of an exposure and / or multiple health outcome counts
  may be included for each time step. In the \texttt{obs} example, three metrics of
  temperature are included (minimum daily temperature, maximum daily temperature,
  and mean daily temperature). Several counts of mortality are included, providing
  information for specific age categories in the population. The different metrics
  of exposure will typically be fit in separate models, either as a sensitivity
  analysis or to explore how exposure measurement affects epidemiological results.
  If different health outcome counts are available, these can be modeled in separate
  statistical models to determine an exposure-response function for each outcome.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{exploratory-data-analysis}{%
\section{Exploratory data analysis}\label{exploratory-data-analysis}}

When working with time series data, it is helpful to start with some exploratory
data analysis. This type of time series data will often be secondary data---it is
data that was previously collected, as you are re-using it. Exploratory data analysis
is particularly important with secondary data like this. For primary data that you
collected yourself, following protocols that you designed yourself, you will often
be very familiar with the structure of the data and any quirks in it by the time
you are ready to fit a statistical model. With secondary data, however, you will
typically start with much less familiarity about the data, how it was collected, and
any potential issues with it, like missing data and outliers.

Exploratory data analysis can help you become familiar with your data. You can use
summaries and plots to explore the parameters of the data, and also to identify
trends and patterns that may be useful in designing an appropriate statistical
model. For example, you can explore how values of the health outcome are distributed,
which can help you determine what type of regression model would be appropriate, and
to see if there are potential confounders that have regular relationships with
both the health outcome and the exposure of interest. You can see how many
observations have missing data for the outcome, the exposure, or confounders of
interest, and you can see if there are any measurements that look unusual.
This can help in identifying quirks in how the data were recorded---for example,
in some cases ground-based weather monitors use -99 or -999 to represent missing
values, definitely something you want to catch and clean-up in your data
(replacing with R's \texttt{NA} for missing values) before fitting a statistical model!

The following applied exercise will take you through some of the
questions you might want to answer through this type of exploratory analysis.
In
general, the \texttt{tidyverse} suite of R packages has loads of tools for exploring and
visualizing data in R.
The \texttt{lubridate} package from the \texttt{tidyverse}, for example, is an excellent tool for working with date-time data
in R, and time series data will typically have at least one column with the
timestamp of the observation (e.g., the date for daily data).
You may find it worthwhile to explore this package some more. There is a helpful
chapter in \citet{wickham2016r}, \url{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html}, as well
as a cheatsheet at
\url{https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_lubridate.pdf}. For
visualizations, if you are still learning techniques in R, two books
you may find useful are
\citet{healy2018data} (available online at \url{https://socviz.co/}) and \citet{chang2018r}
(available online at \url{http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/}).

\emph{Applied: Exploring time series data}

Read the example time series data into R and explore it to answer the following
questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the study period for the example \texttt{obs} dataset? (i.e., what
  dates / years are covered by the time series data?)
\item
  Are there any missing dates (i.e., dates with nothing recorded) within this time
  period? Are there any recorded dates where health outcome measurements are missing?
  Any where exposure measurements are missing?
\item
  Are there seasonal trends in the exposure? In the outcome?
\item
  Are there long-term trends in the exposure? In the outcome?
\item
  Is the outcome associated with day of week? Is the exposure associated
  with day of week?
\end{enumerate}

Based on your exploratory analysis in this section, talk about the potential
for confounding when these data are analyzed to estimate the association between
daily temperature and city-wide mortality. Is confounding by seasonal trends
a concern? How about confounding by long-term trends in exposure and mortality?
How about confounding by day of week?

\emph{Applied exercise: Example code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{What is the study period for the example \texttt{obs} dataset? (i.e., what
  dates / years are covered by the time series data?)}
\end{enumerate}

In the \texttt{obs} dataset, the date of each observation is included in a column called
\texttt{date}. The data type of this column is ``Date''---you can check this by using
the \texttt{class} function from base R:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "Date"
\end{verbatim}

Since this column has a ``Date'' data type, you can run some mathematical function
calls on it. For example, you can use the \texttt{min} function from base R to get the
earliest date in the dataset and the \texttt{max} function to get the latest.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{min}\NormalTok{(obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1990-01-01"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{max}\NormalTok{(obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "2012-08-31"
\end{verbatim}

You can also run the \texttt{range} function to get both the earliest and latest dates
with a single call:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{range}\NormalTok{(obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1990-01-01" "2012-08-31"
\end{verbatim}

This provides the range of the study period for these data. One interesting point
is that it's not a round set of years---instead, the data ends during the summer
of the last study year. This doesn't present a big problem, but is certainly
something to keep in mind if you're trying to calculate yearly averages of
any values for the dataset. If you're getting the average of something that varies
by season (e.g., temperature), it could be slightly weighted by the months that
are included versus excluded in the partial final year of the dataset. Similarly,
if you group by year and then count totals by year, the number will be smaller
for the last year, since only part of the year's included. For example, if you
wanted to count the total deaths in each year of the study period, it will look
like they go down a lot the last year, when really it's only because only about half
of the last year is included in the study period:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{obs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(year) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{deaths\_in\_year =} \FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(all)) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ year, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ deaths\_in\_year)) }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{+}
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{() }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-7-1.pdf}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Are there any missing dates within this time period? Are there any recorded
  dates where health outcome measurements are missing?
  Any where exposure measurements are missing?}
\end{enumerate}

There are a few things you should check to answer this question. First
(and easiest), you can check to see if there are any \texttt{NA} values within
any of the observations in the dataset. This helps answer the second and third
parts of the question. The \texttt{summary} function will provide
a summary of the values in each column of the dataset, including the count
of missing values (\texttt{NA}s) if there are any:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(obs)}

Based on this analysis, all observations are complete for all dates included
in the dataset. There are no listings for \texttt{NA}s for any of the columns, and
this indicates no missing values in the dates for which there's a row in the data.

However, this does not guarantee that every date between the start date and
end date of the study period are included in the recorded data. Sometimes,
some dates might not get recorded at all in the dataset, and the \texttt{summary}
function won't help you determine when this is the case. One common example in
environmental epidemiology is with ozone pollution data. These are sometimes
only measured in the warm season, and so may be shared in a dataset with all
dates outside of the warm season excluded.

There are a few alternative explorations you can do to check this. Perhaps the
easiest is to check
the number of days between the start and end date of the study period, and
then see if the number of observations in the dataset is the same:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Calculate number of days in study period}
\NormalTok{obs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}            \CommentTok{\# Using piping (\%\textgreater{}\%) throughout to keep code clear}
  \FunctionTok{pull}\NormalTok{(date) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}   \CommentTok{\# Extract the \textasciigrave{}date\textasciigrave{} column as a vector}
  \FunctionTok{range}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}      \CommentTok{\# Take the range of dates (earliest and latest)}
  \FunctionTok{diff}\NormalTok{()           }\CommentTok{\# Calculate time difference from start to finish of study }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Time difference of 8278 days
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Get number of observations in dataset{-}{-}{-}should be 1 more than time difference}
\NormalTok{obs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{nrow}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 8279
\end{verbatim}

This indicates that there is an observation for every date over the study period,
since the number of observations should be one more than the time difference.
In the next question, we'll be plotting observations by time, and typically this
will also help you see if there are large chunks of missing dates in the data.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Are there seasonal trends in the exposure? In the outcome?}
\end{enumerate}

You can use a simple plot to visualize patterns over time in both the exposure
and the outcome. For example, the following code plots a dot for each daily
temperature observation over the study period. The points are set to a smaller
size (\texttt{size\ =\ 0.5}) and plotted with some transparency (\texttt{alpha\ =\ 0.5}) since
there are so many observations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ date, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ tmean)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{size =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-10-1.pdf}

There is (unsurprisingly) clear evidence here of a strong seasonal trend in mean temperature,
with values typically lowest in the winter and highest in the summer.

You can plot the outcome variable in the same way:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ date, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ all)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{size =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-11-1.pdf}

Again, there are seasonal trends, although in this case they are inversed.
Mortality tends to be highest in the winter and lowest in the summer. Further, the
seasonal pattern is not equally strong in all years---some years it has a much
higher winter peak, probably in conjunction with severe influenza seasons.

Another way to look for seasonal trends is with a heatmap-style visualization,
with day of year along the x-axis and year along the y-axis. This allows you
to see patterns that repeat around the same time of the year each year (and
also unusual deviations from normal seasonal patterns).

For example, here's a plot showing temperature in each year, where the
observations are aligned on the x-axis by time in year. We're using the \texttt{doy}---which stands for ``day of year'' (i.e., Jan 1 = 1; Jan 2 = 2; \ldots{} Dec 31 = 365 as long
as it's not a leap year) as the measure of time in the year. We've reversed
the y-axis so that the earliest years in the study period start at the top
of the visual, then later study years come later---this is a personal style,
and it would be no problem to leave the y-axis as-is. We've used the
\texttt{viridis} color scale for the fill, since that has a number of features
that make it preferable to the default R color scale, including that it
is perceptible for most types of color blindness and be printed out in grayscale
and still be correctly interpreted.

From this visualization, you can see that temperatures tend to be higher in the
summer months and lower in the winter months. ``Spells'' of extreme heat or cold
are visible---where extreme temperatures tend to persist over a period, rather
than randomly fluctuating within a season. You can also see unusual events, like
the extreme heat wave in the summer of 2003, indicated with the brightest
yellow in the plot.

We created the same style of plot for the health outcome. In this case, we
focused on mortality among the oldest age group, as temperature sensitivity
tends to increase with age, so this might be where the strongest patterns are
evident.

For mortality, there tends to be an increase in the winter compared to the summer.
Some winters have stretches with particularly high mortality---these are likely
a result of seasons with strong influenza outbreaks. You can also see on this
plot the impact of the 2003 heat wave on mortality among this oldest age group---an
unusual spot of light green in the summer.

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  \textbf{Are there long-term trends in the exposure? In the outcome?}
\end{enumerate}

Some of the plots we created in the last section help in exploring this
question. For example, the following plot shows a clear pattern of decreasing
daily mortality counts, on average, over the course of the study period:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ date, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ all)) }\SpecialCharTok{+}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-14-1.pdf}

It can be helpful to add a smooth line to help detect these longer-term
patterns, which you can do with \texttt{geom\_smooth}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ date, }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ all)) }\SpecialCharTok{+}

  \FunctionTok{geom\_smooth}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-15-1.pdf}

You could also take the median mortality count across each year in the
study period, although you should take out any years without a full year's
worth of data before you do this, since there are seasonal trends in the
outcome:

Again, we see a clear pattern of decreasing mortality rates in this city over time.
This means we need to think carefully about long-term time patterns as a potential
confounder. It will be particularly important to think about this if the exposure
also has a strong pattern over time. For example, air pollution regulations have
meant that, in many cities, there may be long-term decreases in pollution
concentrations over a study period.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{4}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Is the outcome associated with day of week? Is the exposure associated
  with day of week?}
\end{enumerate}

The data already has day of week as a column in the data (\texttt{dow}). However,
this is in a character data type, so it doesn't have the order of weekdays
encoded (e.g., Monday comes before Tuesday). This makes it hard to look for
patterns related to things like weekend / weekday.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{dow)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "character"
\end{verbatim}

We could convert this to a factor and encode the weekday order when we do
it, but it's even easier to just recreate the column from the \texttt{date} column.
We used the \texttt{wday} function from the \texttt{lubridate} package to do this---it extracts
weekday as a factor, with the order of weekdays encoded (using a special
``ordered'' factor type):

We looked at the mean, median, and 25th and 75th quantiles of the mortality

Mortality tends to be a bit higher on weekdays than weekends, but it's not
a dramatic difference.

We did the same check for temperature:

In this case, there does not seem to be much of a pattern by weekday.

You can also visualize the association using boxplots:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(obs, }\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =} \FunctionTok{wday}\NormalTok{(date, }\AttributeTok{label =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{), }\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ all)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_boxplot}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-21-1.pdf}

You can also try violin plots---these show the full distribution better than
boxplots, which only show quantiles.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-22-1.pdf}

All these reinforce that there are some small differences in weekend versus weekday
patterns for mortality. There isn't much pattern by weekday with temperature, so
in this case weekday is unlikely to be a confounder (the same is not true with
air pollution, which often varies based on commuting patterns and so can have
stronger weekend/weekday differences). However, since it does help some in explaining
variation in the health outcome, it might be worth including in our models anyway,
to help reduce random noise.

Exploratory data analysis is an excellent tool for exploring your data before
you begin fitting a statistical model, and you should get in the habit of using
it regularly in your research. \citet{dominici2008statistical5} provides another walk-through of exploring this type of data, including some more advanced tools
for exploring autocorrelation and time patterns.

\hypertarget{statistical-modeling-for-a-time-series-study}{%
\section{Statistical modeling for a time series study}\label{statistical-modeling-for-a-time-series-study}}

Now that we've explored the data typical of a time series study in climate
epidemiology, we'll look at how we can fit a statistical model to those
data to gain insight into the relationship between the exposure and
acute health effects. Very broadly, we'll be using a statistical model to answer
the question: How does the relative risk of a health outcome change as
the level of the exposure changes, after controlling for potential confounders?

In the rest of this chapter and the next chapter, we'll
move step-by-step to build up to the statistical models that are now typically
used in these studies.
Along the way, we'll discuss key components and choices in this modeling process.
The statistical modeling is based heavily on regression modeling, and specifically
generalized linear regression. To help you get the most of this section, you
may find it helpful to review regression modeling and generalized linear models.
Some resources for that include \citet{dunn2018generalized1} and \citet{james2013introduction3} .

One of the readings for this week, \citet{vicedo2019hands}, includes a section
on fitting exposure-response functions to describe the association between
daily mean temperature and mortality risk. This article includes example
code in its supplemental material, with code for fitting the model to
these time series data in the file named ``01EstimationERassociation.r''.
Please download that file and take a look at the code.

The model in the code may at first seem complex, but it is made up of a number of
fairly straightforward pieces (although some may initially seem complex):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The model framework is a \emph{generalized linear model (GLM)}
\item
  This GLM is fit assuming an \emph{error distribution} and a \emph{link function}
  appropriate for count data
\item
  The GLM is fit assuming an \emph{error distribution} that is also appropriate for
  data that may be \emph{overdispersed}
\item
  The model includes control for day of the week by including a \emph{categorical
  variable}
\item
  The model includes control for long-term and seasonal trends by including
  a \emph{spline} (in this case, a \emph{natural cubic spline}) for the day in the study
\item
  The model fits a flexible, non-linear association between temperature
  and mortality risk, also using a spline
\item
  The model fits a flexible non-linear association between temperature on
  a series of preceeding days and current day and mortality risk on the
  current day using a \emph{distributed lag approach}
\item
  The model jointly describes both of the two previous non-linear associations
  by fitting these two elements through one construct in the GLM, a
  \emph{cross-basis term}
\end{itemize}

In this section and the next chapter, we will work through the elements,
building up the code to get to the full model that is fit in \citet{vicedo2019hands}.

\emph{Fitting a GLM to time series data}

The generalized linear model (GLM) framework unites a number of types of
regression models you may have previously worked with. One basic regression
model that can be fit within this framework is a linear regression model.
However, the framework also allows you to also fit, among others, logistic
regression models (useful when the outcome variable can only take one of two
values, e.g., success / failure or alive / dead) and Poisson regression models
(useful when the outcome variable is a count or rate). This generalized
framework brings some unity to these different types of regression models. From
a practical standpoint, it has allowed software developers to easily provide a
common interface to fit these types of models. In R, the common function call to
fit GLMs is \texttt{glm}.

Within the GLM framework, the elements that separate different regression models
include the link function and the error distribution. The error distribution
encodes the assumption you are enforcing about how the errors after fitting the
model are distributed. If the outcome data are normally distributed (a.k.a.,
follow a Gaussian distribution), after accounting for variance explained in the
outcome by any of the model covariates, then a linear regression model may be
appropriate. For count data---like numbers of deaths a day---this is unlikely,
unless the average daily mortality count is very high (count data tend to
come closer to a normal distribution the further their average gets from
0). For binary data---like whether each person in a study population died on
a given day or not---normally distributed errors are also unlikely. Instead,
in these two cases, it is typically more appropriate to fit GLMs with
Poisson and binomial ``families'', respectively, where the family designation
includes an appropriate specification for the variance when fitting the model
based on these outcome types.

The other element that distinguishes different types of regression within
the GLM framework is the link function. The link function applies a transformation
on the combination of independent variables in the regression equation
when fitting the model. With normally distributed data, an \emph{identity link}
is often appropriate---with this link, the combination of independent variables
remain unchanged (i.e., keep their initial ``identity''). With count data, a
\emph{log link} is often more appropriate, while with binomial data, a \emph{logit link}
is often used.

Finally, data will often not perfectly adhere to assumptions. For example, the
Poisson family of GLMs assumes that variance follows a Poisson distribution
(The probability mass function for Poisson distribution \(X \sim {\sf Poisson}(\mu)\) is denoted by \(f(k;\mu)=Pr[X=k]= \displaystyle \frac{\mu^{k}e^{-\mu}}{k!}\), where
\(k\) is the number of occurences, and \(\mu\) is equal to the expected number of
cases). With this distribution, the variance is equal to the mean (\(\mu=E(X)=Var(X)\)). With real-life data, this assumption is often not valid, and in many cases the variance in real life count data is larger than the mean. This can be accounted for when fitting a GLM by setting an error distribution that does not require the variance to equal the mean---instead, both a mean value and something like a
variance are estimated from the data, assuming an overdispersion parameter \(\phi\)
so that \(Var(X)=\phi E(X)\). In environmental epidemiology, time series
are often fit to allow for this overdispersion. This is because if the data are overdispersed but the model does not account for this, the standard errors on the
estimates of the model parameters may be artificially small. If the data are not overdispersed (\(\phi=1\)), the model will identify this when being fit to the data,
so it is typically better to prefer to allow for overdispersion in the model
(if the size of the data were small, you may want to be parsimonious and avoid
unneeded complexity in the model, but this is typically not the case with time
series data).

In the next section, you will work through the steps of developing a GLM to fit
the example dataset \texttt{obs}. For now, you will only fit a linear association
between mean daily temperature and mortality risk, eventually including control
for day of week. In later work, especially the next chapter, we will build up
other components of the model, including control for the potential confounders
of long-term and seasonal patterns, as well as advancing the model to fit
non-linear associations, distributed by time, through splines, a distributed lag
approach, and a cross-basis term.

\emph{Applied: Fitting a GLM to time series data}

In R, the function call used to fit GLMs is \texttt{glm}. Most of you have likely
covered GLMs, and ideally this function call, in previous courses. If you are
unfamiliar with its basic use, you will want to refresh yourself on this
topic---you can use some of the resources noted earlier in this section and in
the chapter's ``Supplemental Readings'' to do so.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Fit a GLM to estimate the association between mean daily temperature (as the
  independent variable) and daily mortality count (as the dependent variable),
  first fitting a linear regression. (Since the mortality data are counts, we will
  want to shift to a different type of regression within the GLM framework, but
  this step allows you to develop a simple \texttt{glm} call, and to remember where to
  include the data and the independent and dependent variables within this
  function call.)
\item
  Change your function call to fit a regression model in the Poisson family.
\item
  Change your function call to allow for overdispersion in the outcome data
  (daily mortality count). How does the estimated coefficient for temperature
  change between the model fit for \#2 and this model? Check both the central
  estimate and its estimated standard error.
\item
  Change your function call to include control for day of week.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Applied exercise: Example code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Fit a GLM to estimate the association between mean daily temperature (as the
  independent variable) and daily mortality count (as the dependent variable),
  first fitting a linear regression.}
\end{enumerate}

This is the model you are fitting:

\(Y_{t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1_{t}+\epsilon\)

where \(Y_{t}\) is the mortality count on day \(t\), \(X1_{t}\) is the mean temperature
for day \(t\) and \(\epsilon\) is the error term. Since this is a linear model we are
assuming a Gaussian error distribution \(\epsilon \sim {\sf N}(0, \sigma^{2})\),
where \(\sigma^{2}\) is the variance not explained by the covariates (here just
temperature).

To do this, you will use the \texttt{glm} call. If you would like to save model fit
results to use later, you assign the output a name as an R object
(\texttt{mod\_linear\_reg} in the example code). If your study data are in a dataframe,
you can specify these data in the \texttt{glm} call with the \texttt{data} parameter.
Once you do this, you can use column names directly in the model formula.
In the model formula, the dependent variable is specified first (\texttt{all}, the
column for daily mortality counts for all ages, in this example), followed
by a tilde (\texttt{\textasciitilde{}}), followed by all independent variables (only \texttt{tmean} in this
example). If multiple independent variables are included, they are joined using
\texttt{+}. We'll see an example when we start adding control for confounders later.

\end{Shaded}

Once you have fit a model and assigned it to an R object, you can explore it
and use resulting values. First, the \texttt{print} method for a regression model
gives some summary information. This method is automatically called if you
enter the model object's name at the console:

Make sure you are familiar with the information provided from the model object,
as well as how to interpret values like the coefficient estimates and their
standard errors and p-values. These basic elements should have been covered in
previous coursework (even if a different programming language was used to fit
the model), and so we will not be covering them in great depth here, but instead
focusing on some of the more advanced elements of how regression models are
commonly fit to data from time series and case-crossover study designs in
environmental epidemiology. For a refresher on the basics of fitting
statistical models in R, you may want to check out Chapters 22 through 24 of
\citet{wickham2016r}, a book that is available online, as well as \citet{dunn2018generalized1} and
\citet{james2013introduction3} .

Finally, there are some newer tools for extracting information from model fit
objects. The \texttt{broom} package extracts different elements from these objects
and returns them in a ``tidy'' data format, which makes it much easier to use
the output further in analysis with functions from the ``tidyverse'' suite of
R packages. These tools are very popular and powerful, and so the \texttt{broom} tools
can be very useful in working with output from regression modeling in R.

The \texttt{broom} package includes three main functions for extracting data from
regression model objects. First, the \texttt{glance} function returns overall data
about the model fit, including the AIC and BIC:

\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{tidy} function returns data at the level of the model coefficients,
including the estimate for each model parameter, its standard error, test
statistic, and p-value.

\end{verbatim}

Finally, the \texttt{augment} function returns data at the level of the original
observations, including the fitted value for each observation, the residual
between the fitted and true value, and some measures of influence on the model
fit.

One way you can use \texttt{augment} is to graph the fitted values for each observation

For more on the \texttt{broom} package, including some excellent examples of how it
can be used to streamline complex regression analyses, see \citet{robinson2014broom}.
There is also a nice example of how it can be used in one of the chapters of
\citet{wickham2016r}, available online at \url{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html}.

\begin{enumerate}

  \textbf{Change your function call to fit a regression model in the Poisson family.}
\end{enumerate}

A linear regression is often not appropriate when fitting a model where the
outcome variable provides counts, as with the example data, since such data
often don't follow a normal distribution. A Poisson regression
is typically preferred.

For a count distribution were \(Y \sim {\sf Poisson(\mu)}\) we typically fit a model
such as

\(g(Y)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1\), where \(g()\) represents the link function, in this
case a log function so that \(log(Y)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1\). We can also express
this as \(Y=exp(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1)\).

In the \texttt{glm} call, you can specify this with the \texttt{family}
parameter, for which ``poisson'' is one choice.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod\_pois\_reg }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ tmean, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ obs, }\AttributeTok{family =} \StringTok{"poisson"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

One thing to keep in mind with this change is that the model now uses a
non-identity link between the combination of independent variable(s) and the
dependent variable. You will need to keep this in mind when you interpret
the estimates of the regression coefficients. While the coefficient estimate
for \texttt{tmean} from the linear regression could be interpreted as the expected
increase in mortality counts for a one-unit (i.e., one degree Celsius) increase
in temperature, now the estimated coefficient should be interpreted as the
expected increase in the natural log-transform of mortality count for a one-unit
increase in temperature.

You can see this even more clearly if you take a look at the association between
temperature for each observation and the expected mortality count fit by the
model. First, if you look at the fitted values without transforming, they
will still be in a state where mortality count is log-transformed. You can
see by looking at the range of the y-scale that these values are for the log
of expected mortality, rather than expected mortality (compare, for example, to
the similar plot shown from the first model, which was linear), and that the fitted
association for that \emph{transformation}, not for untransformed mortality counts, is linear:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-32-1.pdf}

You can use exponentiation to transform the fitted values back to just be the
expected mortality count based on the model fit. Once you make this
transformation, you can see how the link in the Poisson family specification
enforced a curved relationship between mean daily temperature and the
untransformed expected mortality count.

For this model, we can interpret the coefficient for the temperature covariate
as the expected log relative risk in the health outcome associated with a
one-unit increase in temperature. We can exponentiate this value to get an
estimate of the relative risk:

If you want to estimate the confidence interval for this estimate, you should
calculate that \emph{before} exponentiating.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}

\item
  \textbf{Change your function call to allow for overdispersion in the outcome data
  (daily mortality count). How does the estimated coefficient for temperature
  change between the model fit for \#2 and this model? Check both the central
  estimate and its estimated standard error.}
\end{enumerate}

In the R \texttt{glm} call, there is a family that is similar to Poisson (including
using a log link), but that allows for overdispersion. You can specify it
with the ``quasipoisson'' choice for the \texttt{family} parameter in the \texttt{glm} call:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod\_ovdisp\_reg }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ tmean, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ obs, }\AttributeTok{family =} \StringTok{"quasipoisson"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When you use this family, there will be some new information in the summary
for the model object. It will now include a dispersion parameter (\(\phi\)). If this
is close to 1, then the data were close to the assumed variance for a Poisson
distribution (i.e., there was little evidence of overdispersion). In the
example, the overdispersion is around 5, suggesting the data are overdispersed
(this might come down some when we start including independent variables that
explain some of the variation in the outcome variable, like long-term and
seasonal trends).

If you compare the estimates of the temperature coefficient from the Poisson
regression with those when you allow for overdispersion, you'll see something
interesting:

\end{verbatim}

The central estimate (\texttt{estimate} column) is very similar. However, the estimated
standard error is larger when the model allows for overdispersion. This
indicates that the Poisson model was too simple, and that its inherent
assumption that data were not overdispersed was problematic. If you naively used
a Poisson regression in this case, then you would estimate a confidence
interval on the temperature coefficient that would be too narrow. This could
cause you to conclude that the estimate was statistically significant when
you should not have (although in this case, the estimate is statistically
significant under both models).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Change your function call to include control for day of week.}
\end{enumerate}

Day of week is included in the data as a categorical variable, using a
data type in R called a factor. You are now essentially fitting this model:

\(log(Y)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}X1+\gamma^{'}X2\),

where \(X2\) is a categorical variable for day of the week and \(\gamma^{'}\)
represents a vector of parameters associated with each category.

It is pretty straightforward to include factors as independent variables in calls
to \texttt{glm}: you just add the column name to the list of other independent variables
with a \texttt{+}. In this case, we need to do one more step: earlier, we added order to
\texttt{dow}, so it would ``remember'' the order of the week days (Monday before Tuesday,
etc.). However, we need to strip off this order before we include the factor in
the \texttt{glm} call. One way to do this is with the \texttt{factor} call, specifying
\texttt{ordered\ =\ FALSE}. Here is the full call to fit this model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod\_ctrl\_dow }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ tmean }\SpecialCharTok{+} \FunctionTok{factor}\NormalTok{(dow, }\AttributeTok{ordered =} \ConstantTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{), }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

When you look at the summary for the model object, you can see that the
model has fit a separate model parameter for six of the seven weekdays. The one
weekday that isn't fit (Sunday in this case) serves as a baseline ---these
estimates specify how the log of the expected mortality count is expected to
differ on, for example, Monday versus Sunday (by about 0.03), if the temperature
is the same for the two days.

You can also see from this summary that the coefficients for the day of the
week are all statistically significant. Even though we didn't see a big
difference in mortality counts by day of week in our exploratory analysis,
this suggests that it does help explain some variance in mortality observations
and will likely be worth including in the final model.

The model now includes day of week when fitting an expected mortality count
for each observation. As a result, if you plot fitted values of expected
mortality versus mean daily temperature, you'll see some ``hoppiness'' in the
fitted line:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod\_ctrl\_dow }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{augment}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-40-1.pdf}

This is because each fitted value is also incorporating the expected influence
of day of week on the mortality count, and that varies across the observations
(i.e., you could have two days with the same temperature, but different
expected mortality from the model, because they occur on different days).

If you plot the model fits separately for each day of the week, you'll see that
the line is smooth across all observations from the same day of the week:

\emph{Wrapping up}

At this point, the coefficient estimates suggests that risk of mortality
tends to decrease as temperature increases. Do you think this is reasonable?
What else might be important to build into the model based on your analysis
up to this point?

\section{Splines in GLMs}\label{splines-in-glms}}

We saw from the last model, with a linear term for mean daily temperature, that the
suggested effect on mortality is a decrease in daily mortality counts with
increasing temperature. However, as you've probably guessed that's likely not
entirely accurate. A linear term for the effect of exposure restricts us to an
effect that can be fitted with a straight line (either a null effect or a
monotonically increasing or decreasing effect with increasing exposure).

This clearly is problematic in some cases. One example is when exploring the
association between temperature and health risk. Based on human physiology,
we would expect many health risks to be elevated at temperature extremes,
whether those are extreme cold or extreme heat. A linear term would be
inadequate to describe this kind of U-shaped association. Other effects might
have a threshold---for example, heat stroke might have a very low risk at
most temperatures, only increasing with temperature above a certain threshold.

We can
capture non-linear patterns in effects, by using different functions of X.
Examples are \(\sqrt{X}\), \(X^{2}\), or more complex smoothing functions, such as
polynomials or splines. Polynomials might at first make a lot of sense,
especially since you've likely come across polynomial terms in mathematics
classes since grade school. However, it turns out that they have some undesirable
properties. A key one is that they can have extreme behavior, particularly
when using a high-order polynomial, and particularly outside the range of
data that are available to fit the model.

An alternative that is generally preferred for environmental epidemiology
studies is the regression spline. The word ``spline'' originally comes from
drafting and engineering (ship building, in particular), where it described
a flexible piece of wood or metal that you could use to draw a curved line---it created
a curve that was flexible enough---but just flexible enough---to fit a space
(see Wikipedia's very interesting article on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_spline}{flat splines} for more).

Splines follow a similar idea in mathematics, making them helpful tools when
a line won't fit your data well. In general, a spline fits together a few
simpler functions to create something with a curve or non-linearity. Each
simpler function operates within an interval of the data, and then they join
together at ``knots'' along the range of the data.
Regression splines are therefore simple parametric smoothing function,
which fit separate polynomial in each interval of the range of the predictor; these
can be linear, quadratic, and cubic.

The simplest example is a linear spline (also called a piecewise linear function).
This type of spline creates non-linearity by having
a breakpoint at the knot, allowing the slope of the line to be different in
the intervals of data on either side of the knot. The following plot shows an
example. Say you want to explore how mean temperature varies by the day in the
year (Jan 1 = 1, Jan 2 = 2, and so on) in the London example dataset from the
last chapter. Temperature tends to increase with day of
year for a while, but then it changes around the start of August, after that
decreasing with day of year. This patterns means that a line will give a bad fit
for how temperature changes with day of year, since it smooths right through that
change. On the other hand, you can get a very reasonable fit using a linear spline
with a knot around August 1 (day 213 in the year). These two examples are shown in
the following plot, with the linear function fit on the left and the linear spline
on the right:

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-42-1.pdf}

If you were to write out these regression models in mathematical notation, the
linear one is very simple:

\[
Y_t = \alpha + \beta X_t
\]
where \(Y_t\) is the temperature on day \(t\), \(\alpha\) is the model intercept,
\(X_t\) is the day of the year on day \(t\), and \(\beta\) is the estimated coefficient
for \(X_t\).

The notation for the model with the linear spline is a bit more complex:

\[
Y_t = \alpha + \beta_1 X_t + \beta_2 (X_t - k)_+
\]

Here, \(Y_t\) is again the temperature on day \(t\), \(X_t\) is again the day of the year
on day \(t\), and \(\alpha\) is again the intercept. The term \(k\) is the ``knot''---the
value of \(X\) where we're letting the slope change. In this example, we're using
\(k = 213\). The term \((X_t - k)_+\) has a special meaning---it takes the value
0 if \(X_t\) is in the interval to the left of the knot, while if \(X_t\) is in the
interval to the right of the knot, it takes the value of \(X_t\) minus the knot
value:

\[ 
(X_t - k)_+ =
\begin{cases}
0, & \mbox{if } X_t < k \\
X_t - k, & \mbox{if } X_t \ge k 
\end{cases}
\]
In this model, the coefficient \(\beta_1\) estimates the slope of the line to the
left of the knot, while \(\beta_2\) estimates how that slope will change to the
right of the knot.

Fortunately, we usually won't have to get this complex in the model notation,
especially when we use more complex splines (where the notation would get even
more complex). Instead, we'll often write out the
regression equation in a simpler way, just indicating that we're using a function
of the covariate, rather than the covariate directly:

\[
Y_t = \alpha + f(X_t | \mathbf{\beta})
\]

where we can note that \(f(X_t)\) is a function of day of the year (\(X_t\)), fit in
this case using a linear spline, and with a set of estimated coefficients \(\mathbf{\beta}\) for that
function (see \citet{armstrong2006models} for an example of using this model notation).

While a linear spline is the simplest conceptually (and mathematically), it often
isn't very satisfying, because it fits a function with a sharp breakpoint, which
often isn't realistic. For example, the linear spline fit above suggests that the
relationship between day of the year and temperature changes abruptly and dramatically
on August 1 of the year. In reality, we know that this change in the relationship
between day of year and temperature is probably a lot smoother.

To fit smoother shapes, we can move to higher level splines. Cubic splines
(``cubic'' because they include terms of the covariate up to the third power) are
very popular.
An example of a cubic spline
function is \(X+X^{2}+X^{3}+I((X>X_{0})*(X-X_{0})^3)\). This particular function is
a cubic spline with four degrees of freedom (\(df=4\)) and one knot (\(X_{0}\)).
A special type of cubic spline called a natural cubic spline is particularly popular.
Unlike a polynomial function, a natural cubic spline ``behaves'' better outside
the range of the data used to fit the model---they are constrained to continue
on a linear trajectory once they pass beyond the range of the data.

Regression splines can be fit in a GLM via the package \texttt{splines}. Two commonly
used examples of regression splines are b-splines and natural cubic
splines. \citet{vicedo2019hands} uses natural cubic splines, which can be fit with the
\texttt{ns} (for ``natural spline'') function from the \texttt{splines} package.

While splines are great for fitting non-linear relationships, they do create some
challenges in interpreting the results. When you fit a linear relationship for
a covariate, you will get a single estimate that helps describe the fitted relationship
between that covariate and the outcome variable. However, when you use a non-linear
function, you'll end up with a mix of coefficients associated with that function.
Sometimes, you will use splines to control for a potential confounder (as we
will in the exercises for this first part of the chapter). In this case, you don't
need to worry about interpreting the estimated coefficients---you're just trying to
control for the variable, rather than inferring anything about how it's associated
with the outcome.
In later parts of this chapter, we'll talk about how to interpret these coefficients
if you're using a spline for the exposure that you're interested in, when we talk
more broadly about basis functions.

\emph{Applied: Including a spline in a GLM}

For this exercise, you will continue to build up the model that you began in
the examples in the previous chapter. The example uses the data provided with
one of this chapter's readings, \citet{vicedo2019hands}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Start by fitting a somewhat simple model---how are daily mortality counts
  associated with (a) a linear and (b) a non-linear function of time? Is a linear
  term appropriate to describe this association? What types of patterns are
  captured by a non-linear function that are missed by a linear function?
\item
  In the last chapter, the final version of the model used a GLM with an
  overdispersed Poisson distribution, including control for day of week.
  Start from this model and add control for long-term and seasonal trends
  over the study period.
\item
  Refine your model to fit for a non-linear, rather than linear, function
  of temperature in the model. Does a non-linear term seem to be more
  appropriate than a linear term?
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Applied exercise: Example code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Start by fitting a somewhat simple model---how are daily mortality counts
  associated with (a) a linear and (b) a non-linear function of time?}
\end{enumerate}

It is helpful to start by loading the R packages you are likely to need, as
well as the example dataset. You may also need to re-load the example data
and perform the steps taken to clean it in the last chapter:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Load some packages that will likely be useful}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(viridis)}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(lubridate)}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(broom)}

\CommentTok{\# Load and clean the data}
\NormalTok{obs }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{read\_csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/lndn\_obs.csv"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{dow =} \FunctionTok{wday}\NormalTok{(date, }\AttributeTok{label =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For this first question, the aim is to model the association between time and
daily mortality counts within the example data. This approach is often used
to explore and, if needed, adjust for temporal factors in the data.

There are a number of factors that can act over time to create patterns in both
environmental exposures and health outcomes. For example, there may be changes
in air pollution exposures over the years of a study because of changes in
regulations or growth or decline of factories and automobile traffic in an area.
Changes in health care and in population demographics can cause patterns in
health outcomes over the study period. At a shorter, seasonal term, there are
also factors that could influence both exposures and outcomes, including
seasonal changes in climate, seasonal changes in emissions, and seasonal
patterns in health outcomes.

It can be difficult to pinpoint and measure these temporal factors, and so
instead a common practice is to include model control based on the time in the
study. This can be measured, for example, as the day since the start of the
study period.

You can easily add a column for day in study for a dataset that
includes date. R saves dates in a special format, which we're using the in
\texttt{obs} dataset:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{date)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "Date"
\end{verbatim}

However, this is just a fancy overlay on a value that's ultimately saved as
a number. Like most Unix programs, the date is saved as the number of days
since the Unix ``epoch'', January 1, 1970. You can take advantage of this
convention---if you use \texttt{as.numeric} around a date in R, it will give you a
number that gets one unit higher for every new date. Here's the example for
the first date in our example data:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{date[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1990-01-01"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{date[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 7305
\end{verbatim}

And here's the example for the next date:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{date[}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "1990-01-02"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{date[}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{])}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 7306
\end{verbatim}

You can use this convention to add a column that gives days since the first
study date. While you could also use the \texttt{1:n()} call to get a number for
each row that goes from 1 to the number of rows, that approach would not
catch any ``skips'' in dates in the data (e.g., missing dates if only warm-season
data are included). The use of the dates is more robust:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{obs }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ obs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{time =} \FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(date) }\SpecialCharTok{{-}} \FunctionTok{first}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{as.numeric}\NormalTok{(date)))}

\NormalTok{obs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{select}\NormalTok{(date, time)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 8,279 x 2
##    date        time
##    <date>     <dbl>
##  1 1990-01-01     0
##  2 1990-01-02     1
##  3 1990-01-03     2
##  4 1990-01-04     3
##  5 1990-01-05     4
##  6 1990-01-06     5
##  7 1990-01-07     6
##  8 1990-01-08     7
##  9 1990-01-09     8
## 10 1990-01-10     9
## # ... with 8,269 more rows
\end{verbatim}

As a next step, it is always useful to use exploratory data analysis to look
at the patterns that might exist for an association, before you start designing
and fitting the regression model.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-48-1.pdf}

There are clear patterns between time and daily mortality counts in these data.
First, there is a clear long-term pattern, with mortality rates declining on
average over time. Second, there are clear seasonal patterns, with higher
mortality generally in the winter and lower rates in the summer.

To model this, we can start with fitting a linear term. In the last chapter,
we determined that the mortality outcome data can be fit using a GLM with a
Poisson family, allowing for overdispersion as it is common in real-life
count data like these. To include time as a linear term, we can just include
that column name to the right of the \texttt{\textasciitilde{}} in the model formula:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod\_time }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ time, }
                \AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ obs, }\AttributeTok{family =} \StringTok{"quasipoisson"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can use the \texttt{augment} function from the \texttt{broom} package to pull out the
fitted estimate for each of the original observations and plot that, along
with the observed data, to get an idea of what this model has captured:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mod\_time }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{augment}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ time)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_point}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ all), }\AttributeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.4}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{size =} \FloatTok{0.5}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_line}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{y =} \FunctionTok{exp}\NormalTok{(.fitted)), }\AttributeTok{color =} \StringTok{"red"}\NormalTok{) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{labs}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =} \StringTok{"Date in study"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{y =} \StringTok{"Expected mortality count"}\NormalTok{) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-50-1.pdf}

This linear trend captures the long-term trend in mortality rates fairly well in
this case. This won't always be the case, as there may be some health
outcomes---or some study populations---where the long-term pattern over the
study period might be less linear than in this example. Further, the linear
term is completely unsuccessful in capturing the shorter-term trends in mortality
rate. These oscillate, and so would be impossible to capture over multiple
years with a linear trend.

Instead, it's helpful to use a non-linear term for time in the model. We can
use a natural cubic spline for this, using the \texttt{ns} function from the \texttt{splines}
package. You will need to clarify how flexible the spline function should be,
and this can be specified through the degrees of freedom for the spline. A
spline with more degrees of freedom will be ``wigglier'' over a given data range
compared to a spline with fewer degrees of freedom. Let's start by using
158 degrees of freedom, which translates to about 7 degrees of freedom per year:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(splines)}
\NormalTok{mod\_time\_nonlin }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{glm}\NormalTok{(all }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}} \FunctionTok{ns}\NormalTok{(time, }\AttributeTok{df =} \DecValTok{158}\NormalTok{), }
                       \AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ obs, }\AttributeTok{family =} \StringTok{"quasipoisson"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can visualize the model results in a similar way to how we visualized the
last model. However, there is one extra step. The \texttt{augment} function only
carries through columns in the original data (\texttt{obs}) that were directly used
in fitting the model. Now that we're using a transformation of the \texttt{time}
column, by wrapping it in \texttt{ns}, the \texttt{time} column is no longer included in the
\texttt{augment} output. However, we can easily add it back in using \texttt{mutate},
pulling it from the original \texttt{obs} dataset, and then proceed as before.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-52-1.pdf}

The non-linear term for time has allowed enough flexibility that the model now
captures both long-term and seasonal trends in the data.

You might wonder how many degrees of freedom you should use for this time spline. In practice,
researchers often using about 6--8 degrees of freedom per year of the study, in
the case of year-round data. You can explore how changing the degrees of freedom
changes the way the model fits to the observed data. As you use more degrees of
freedom, the line will capture very short-term effects, and may start to
interfere with the shorter-term associations between environmental exposures and
health risk that you are trying to capture. Even in the example model we just
fit, for example, it looks like the control for time may be capturing some
patterns that were likely caused by heatwaves (the rare summer peaks, including
one from the 1995 heatwave). Conversely, if too few degrees of freedom are used,
the model will shift to look much more like the linear model, with inadequate
control for seasonal patterns.

You can see that there are multiple model coefficients for the variable fit
using a spline function, one less than the number of degrees of freedom. These
model coefficients are very hard to interpret on their own. When we are using
the spline to \emph{control} for a factor that might serve as a confounder of the
association of interest, we typically won't need to try to interpret these
model coefficients---instead, we are interested in accounting for how this
factor explains variability in the outcome, without needing to quantify the
association as a key result. However, there are also cases where we want to
use a spline to fit the association with the exposure that we are interested
in. In this case, we will want to be able to interpret model coefficients from
the spline. Later in this chapter, we will introduce the \texttt{dlnm} package, which
includes functions to both fit and interpret natural cubic splines within
GLMs for environmental epidemiology.

  \textbf{Start from the last model created in the last chapter and add control for
  long-term and seasonal trends over the study period.}
\end{enumerate}

The last model fit in the last chapter was the following, which fits for the
association between a linear term of temperature and mortality risk, with control
for day of week:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To add control for long-term and seasonal trends, you can take the natural cubic
spline function of temperature that you just fit and include it among the
explanatory / independent variables from the model in the last chapter. If you
want to control for only long-term trends, a linear term of the \texttt{time} column
could work, as we discovered in the first part of this chapter's exercise.
However, seasonal trends could certainly confound the association of interest.
Mortality rates have a clear seasonal pattern, and temperature does as well,
and these patterns create the potential for confounding when we look at how
temperature and mortality risk are associated, beyond any seasonally-driven
pathways.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can see the influence of this seasonal confounding if you look at the model
results. When we look at the results from the model that did not control for
long-term and seasonal trends, we get an estimate that mortality rates tend to
be lower on days with higher temperature, with a negative term for \texttt{tmean}:

\end{verbatim}

Conversely, when we include control for long-term and seasonal trends, the
estimated association between mortality rates and temperature is reversed,
estimating increased mortality rates on days with higher temperature, \emph{controlling
for long-term and seasonal trends}:

  \textbf{Refine your model to fit for a non-linear, rather than linear, function
  of temperature in the model.}
\end{enumerate}

You can use a spline in the same way to fit a non-linear function for the
exposure of interest in the model (temperature). We'll start there. However,
as mentioned earlier, it's a bit tricky to interpret the coefficients from the
fit model---you no longer generate a single coefficient for the exposure of
interest, but instead several related to the spline. Therefore, once we show
how to fit using \texttt{ns} directly, we'll show how you can do the same thing using
specialized functions in the \texttt{dlnm} package. This package includes a lot of
nice functions for not only fitting an association using a non-linear term,
but also for interpreting the results after the model is fit.

First, here is code that can be used to fit the model using \texttt{ns} directly,
similarly to the approach we used to control for temporal patterns with a
flexible function:

                          \FunctionTok{ns}\NormalTok{(time, }\AttributeTok{df =} \DecValTok{158}\NormalTok{), }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can plot the predicted values from this fitted model (red points in the plot below)
compared to the observed data (black dots) using our usual method of using \texttt{augment} to
extract the predicted values:

However, these predictions are very variable at any given temperature. This reflects how
other independent variables, like long-term and seasonal trends, explain variability in
mortality. This makes sense, but it makes it a bit hard to investigate the role of temperature
specifically. Let's look, then, at some other options for viewing the results that will
help us focus on the association of the exposure we care about (temperature) with the outcome.

The next part has a lot of steps, so it might at first seem confusing. However, fortunately
we won't always have to do all the steps ourselves---there is a nice R package that
will help us. We'll look at the process first, though, and then the easier way to use a
package to help with some of the steps. Also, this process gives us a first look at how
the idea of basis functions work. We'll later expand on these to look at non-linear
relationships with the exposure at different lag times, using cross-basis functions, so this
forms a starting point for moving into the idea of a cross-basis.

First, we need to think about how temperature gets included in the regression
model---specifically, as a function of \emph{basis variables} rather than as a single variable.
In other words, to include temperature as a nonlinear function, we're going to create
a structure in the regression equation that includes the variable of temperature in
several different terms, in different transformations in each term. I simple example of this
is a second-degree polynomial. If we wanted to include a second-order polynomial function
of temperature in the regression, then we'd use the following basis:

\[
\beta_1 T + \beta_2 T^2
\]

Notice that here we're using the same independent variable (\(T\), which stands for daily
temperature), but we're including both untransformed \(T\) and also \(T\) squared. This function
of \(T\) might go into the regression equation as something like:

\[
E(Y) = \alpha + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 T^2 + ns(time) + \mathbf{\gamma^{'}D}
\]
where \(\alpha\) is the intercept, \(ns(time)\) is a natural cubic spline that controls for
time (long-term and seasonal trends) and \(\mathbf{D}\) is day of week, with \(\mathbf{\gamma}\) as
the set of coefficients associated with day of week. (Here, I've included the outcome,
\(Y\), untransformed, as you would for a linear regression, but of course the same idea
works with Poisson regression, when you'd instead have \(log(E(Y))\) on the left of the
equation.)

When you fit a regression model in a program like R, it sets up the observed data into
something called a \emph{model matrix}, where it has the values for each observation for each of
the independent variables you want to include, plus a column of ``1''s for the intercept, if you
model structure includes one. The regression model will fit a coefficient
for each of these columns in the model matrix. In a simple case, this model matrix will just
repeat each of your independent variables. For example, the model matrix for the model
\texttt{mod\_overdisp\_reg}, which we fit in the last chapter and which included only an intercept
and a linear term for \texttt{tmean}, looks like this (the \texttt{model.matrix} function will give you
the model matrix of any \texttt{glm} object that you get by running the \texttt{glm} function in R):

You can see that the regression call broke the day-of-week variable up into a set of indicator variables, which
equal either 1 or 0. There will be one less of these than the number of categories for the
variable; in otherwords, if the categorical variable took two values (Weekend / Weekday), then
this would be covered by a single column; since there are seven days in the week, the
day-of-week variable breaks into six (7 - 1) columns. The first level of the categories
(Sunday in this case) serves as a baseline and doesn't get a value. The others levels
(Monday, Tuesday, etc.) each get their own indicator variable---so, their own column in
the model matrix---which equals ``1'' on that day (i.e., ``1'' for the Monday column if the date
of the observation is a Monday) and ``0'' on all other days.

Now let's go back and look at the example of including temperature in the model as a nonlinear
function, starting with the simple example of using a second-degree polynomial. What would
the basis for that look like? We can find out by fitting the model and then looking at the
model matrix (the \texttt{I()} function lets us specify a transformation of a column from the
data when we set up the regression equation structure in \texttt{glm}):

You can see that this has created two columns based on the temperature variable, one with
it untransformed and one with it squared. The regression will estimate coefficients for each
of these basis variables of temperature, and then that allows you to fit a model with a
function of temperature, rather than solely temperature. Here are the coefficients from
this model:

Therefore, it's fit the following model to describe the association between temperature and
mortality:

\[
log(E(Y)) = 5.3092 - 0.0298T + 0.0007T^2

If you want to estimate the relative risk of mortality at 15 degrees Celsius versus 10
degrees Celsius with this model (which is confounded by long-term and seasonal trends, so
has some issues we'll want to fix), you can take the following process. Take the two
equations for the expected mortality when \(T\) is 15 and 10, respectively:

\[
log(E(Y|T=15)) = 5.3092 - 0.0298(15) + 0.0007(15^2) \\
log(E(Y|T=10)) = 5.3092 - 0.0298(10) + 0.0007(10^2)  
\]
If you subtract the second from the first, you get:

\[
log(E(Y|T=15)) - log(E(Y|T=10)) = (5.3092 - 5.3092) - 0.0298(15 - 10) + 0.0007(15^2 - 10^2)
\]
which simplifies to (if the left part isn't clear, review the rules for how you can manipulate
logarithms):

\[
log(\frac{E(Y|T=15)}{E(Y|T=10)}) = - 0.0298(5) + 0.0007(125) = -0.0615
\]
Exponentiate both sides, to get to the relative risk at 15 degrees versus 10 degrees (in
other words, the ratio of expected mortality at 15 degrees to that at 10 degrees):

\[
\frac{E(Y|T=15)}{E(Y|T=10)} = e^{-0.0615} =  0.94
\]
You can see that the basis variables are great in helping us explore how an independent
variable might be related to the outcome in a non-linear way, but there's a bit of a cost
in terms of us needing to take some extra steps to interpret the results from that model.
Also, note that there's not a single coefficient that we can extract from the model as
a summary of the relationship. Instead, we needed to pick a reference temperature (10 degrees
in this example) and compare to that to get an estimated relative risk. We'll see the
same pattern as we move to using natural cubic splines to create the basis variables for
temperature.

Now let's move to a spline. The function the spline runs to transform the temperature
variable into the different basis variables is more complex than for the polynomial example,
but the result is similar: you get several columns to fit in the model for a variable, compared
to the single column you would include if you were only fitting a linear term. If you
take a look at the output of running the \texttt{ns} function on temperature in the data, you can
see that it creates several new columns (one for each degree of freedom), which will be the
basis variables in the regression:

\end{verbatim}

The output from \texttt{ns} also has some metadata, included in the attributes of the object, that
have some other information about the spline function, including where the knots were
placed and where the boundary knots (which are at the outer ranges of the data) are placed.
You can the \texttt{str} function to explore both the data and metadata stored in this object:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

This is saying, for example, that the internal knots for this spline were put at the
25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles of the temperature data, where were 7.47 degrees, 11.47 degrees,
and 15.93 degrees. (The defaults for \texttt{ns} is to place knots evenly at percentiles, based
on the number of degrees of freedom you specify. You can change this by placing the knots
``by hand'', using the \texttt{knots} argument in the \texttt{ns} function.)

This spline object can be used not just for its basis values, but also to ``predict'' new
basis values for a new set of temperature values. For example, you could figure out
what the basis values from this spline would be for every degree of temperature between
-6 and 29 using the following code:

This is handy, because it will help us visualize the relationship we fit in a regression
model---we can start with these basis values for each degree in our temperature range, and
then use the regression coefficients for each basis variable to estimate relative risk
at that temperature compared to a reference temperature, exactly as we did in the equations
for the polynomial function of temperature earlier, comparing 15 degrees C to the reference
of 10 degrees.

All we need now are the regression coefficients for each of these temperature basis
variables. We can extract those from the model we fit earlier, where we included
\texttt{ns(tmean,\ 4)} as one of the model terms. Here, I'm using \texttt{tidy} to get the model
coefficients and then, because there are \emph{lots} of them (from fitting a spline for
time with lots of degrees of freedom), I'm using the \texttt{str\_detect} function from the
\texttt{stringr} package to pick out just those with ``tmean'' in the \texttt{term} column:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

You can add on \texttt{pull} to pull out just the \texttt{estimate} column as a vector, which will be
helpful when we want to multiple these coefficients by the basis values for each degree
of temperature across our temperature range:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{verbatim}

Now, let's put this together to see how relative risk of mortality changes as you move
across the temperature range! First, we can set up a dataframe that has a column with
each unit of temperature across our range---these are the temperatures where we want to
estimate relative risk---and then the estimated relative risk at that temperature. By
default, we'll be comparing to the lowest temperature in the original data, but we'll talk
in a minute about how to adjust to a different reference temperature. You can use
matrix multiplication (\texttt{\%*\%}) as a shorthand way to multiple each column of the spline
basis variables from \texttt{temp\_spline\_preds} by its estimated coefficient from the regression
model, saved in \texttt{temp\_spline\_ests}, and then add all of those values together (this is
the same idea as what we did in the equations earlier, for the polynomial basis). Then,
to get from log relative risk to relative risk, we'll exponentiate that with \texttt{exp}. You
can see the first rows of the results below:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pred\_temp\_function }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{tibble}\NormalTok{(}
  \AttributeTok{temp =} \SpecialCharTok{{-}}\DecValTok{5}\SpecialCharTok{:}\DecValTok{30}\NormalTok{, }
  \AttributeTok{temp\_func =}\NormalTok{ temp\_spline\_preds }\SpecialCharTok{\%*\%}\NormalTok{ temp\_spline\_ests,}
  \AttributeTok{rr =} \FunctionTok{exp}\NormalTok{(temp\_func)}
\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{pred\_temp\_function }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

## 6     0      -0.0510   0.950
\end{verbatim}

This is now very easy to plot, with a reference line added at a relative risk of 1.0:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-73-1.pdf}

We might want to shift this, so we're comparing the temperature at which mortality risk
is lowest (sometimes called the \emph{minimum mortality temperature}). This tends to be at
milder temperatures, in the middle of our range, rather than at the minimum temperature in
the range. To start, let's see what temperature aligns with the lowest relative risk of
mortality:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{pred\_temp\_function }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{filter}\NormalTok{(rr }\SpecialCharTok{==} \FunctionTok{min}\NormalTok{(rr))}

##   <int>         <dbl>  <dbl>
## 1     7       -0.0938  0.911
\end{verbatim}

We can therefore realign so that the relative risk equals 1.0 when the temperature is 7 degrees
C, and all other relative risks are relative to a reference temperature of 7 degrees C:

\end{Shaded}

This is a fairly cumbersome process, as you've seen with this example, and it would be a
pain if we had to do it every time we wanted to visualize and explore results from fitting
regressions that include basis variables from splines. Fortunately, there's a nice R package
called \texttt{dlnm} (for ``distributed lag nonlinear models'') that will help take care of a lot of
these ``under the hood'' steps for us. Even better, this package will let us move on to more
complex crossbasis functions, where we fit non-linear functions in two dimensions, and help
us visualize and interpret results from those models.

To start, make sure you have the \texttt{dlnm} package installed on your computer, and then load
it in your R session. This package has a function called \texttt{crossbasis} that lets you build
a crossbasis function to use in a regression model. We'll talk more about these types
of functions later in this chapter; for right now, we'll be a bit simpler and just use it
to create our spline function of temperature.

In the \texttt{crossbasis} function, you start by putting in the vector of the variable that you
want to expand into basis variables. In our case, this is temperature, which we have saved
as the \texttt{tmean} column in the \texttt{obs} dataset. You use the \texttt{argvar} to give some information
about the basis you want to use for that variable. This will both include the type of
basis function (\texttt{"ns"} for a natural cubic spline), and then also arguments you want to
pass to that basis function, like degrees of freedom (\texttt{df}) or knot locations (\texttt{knots})
if you're fitting a spline. The other arguments allow you to specify a function of lagged
time; we won't use that yet, so you can just include \texttt{lag\ =\ 0} and \texttt{arglag\ =\ list(fun\ =\ "integer")} to create a crossbasis where we only consider same-day effects in a simple way.
If you look at the output, you'll see it's very similar to the basis created by the
\texttt{ns} call earlier (in fact, the values in each column should be identical):

To estimate the regression coefficients, we'll put this whole crossbasis in as one of
our terms in the \texttt{glm} regression equation:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As when we fit the spline earlier, you can see that this gives us a set of coefficients,
one for each column in the matrix of crossbasis variables:

However, there's an advantage with using \texttt{crossbasis}, even though it's looked pretty similar
to using \texttt{ns} up to now. That's that there are some special functions that let us predict
and visualize the model results without having to do all the work we did before.

For example, there's a function called \texttt{crosspred} that will give us a number of values,
including the estimated relative risk compared to a reference value. To use this, we
need to input the object name of our crossbasis object (\texttt{temp\_basis}) and the name of our
regression model object (\texttt{dlnm\_mod\_1}). We also want to tell it which temperature we want
to use as our reference (\texttt{cen\ =\ 7} to compare everything to 7 degrees C) and what interval
we want for predictions (\texttt{by\ =\ 1} will give us an estimate for every degree temperature
along our range). The output is a list with a lot of elements, which you can get a view of
with \texttt{str}:

The one we'll look at right now is \texttt{allRRfit}. You can extract it with (here I'm showing

To make it easier to work with, let's put this in a dataframe. Note that the temperatures
are included as the names in the vector, so we can extract those with \texttt{names}:

This has gotten us (much more quickly!) to estimates of the relative risk of mortality at
each temperature compared to a reference of 7 degrees C. We can plot this the same way we
did earlier, and you'll notice that this plot is identical to the one we created based on the

The \texttt{dlnm} package also includes some functions specifically for plotting. One downside
is that they're in base R, rather than based on \texttt{ggplot2}, which makes them a bit
harder to customize. However, they're a great way to get a first look at your results:

Don't worry if all of this about basis functions is a lot! If this is the first time you've
seen this, it will likely take a few passes to get comfortable with it---and while the idea
of basis variables is fairly straightforward, it's certainly not straightforward to figure
out how to interpret the results of the model that you fit. It is worth the effort, though,
as this is a very powerful tool when working with regression modeling in environmental
epidemiology.

\hypertarget{distributed-lags-and-cross-basis-functions-in-glms}{%
\section{Distributed lags and cross-basis functions in GLMs}\label{distributed-lags-and-cross-basis-functions-in-glms}}

Next, let's explore how we can add into our model something that lets us look at
delayed effects and the potential for mortality displacement. So far, we have only
considered how temperature affects mortality risk on the day of exposure---in other
words, if it is very hot today, does risk of mortality go up substantially today?
For many exposures, however, risk can persist after the day of exposure.

In some cases, this may be caused by a delay in detection of the outcome in the
data we have. For example, extreme heat today could precipitate a respiratory or
cardiac event that the person may not seek treatment for or result in an outcome
like mortality until tomorrow, and so in the data the outcome would be recorded
at a one-day delay from the exposure.

In other cases, the path from the exposure to the outcome may take several days.
For example, cold temperatures are often found to be associated with respiratory
outcomes a week or more after exposures (something you can look for in the
example data!), and one potential pathway is that cold temperatures might
promote the spread of respiratory infectious disease, like influenza and colds,
both through making people stay inside in more crowded, less ventilated
conditions and also through effects on humidity and other conditions that might
influence the behavior of respiratory droplets, which are key players in
spreading some respiratory diseases. Since there is an incubation time up to
several days for these infectious diseases, we might expect a lagged association
between temperature and respiratory outcomes under this scenario.

There is another lagged pattern that can be important to check for, as well---one
that indicates mortality displacement. For many ambient environmental exposures,
there are clear indications that associations with health outcomes are strongest
among older adults or other populations with a disproportionately high percent
of people who are frail before exposure. One question that comes up, then, is
if, when an exposure is associated with excess deaths, these are deaths that are
displaced in time by only a few days or weeks, rather than deaths that represent
a larger time of life lost. This question---of whether deaths observed to be
associated with an environmental exposure were displaced by only a small amount of
time---can be explored by investigating whether an observed increase in mortality
across a community during an exposure is then offset by a lower-than-expected
rate of mortality in the following days and weeks.This phenomenon is sometimes\\
also referred to as `harvesting' or a `harvesting effect'.

All of these questions can be explored through a type of model called a
\emph{distributed lag model}. Conceptually, these models investigate how an exposure
today is associated with risk of a health outcome not only today, but also in
the following days. In time-series studies where we typically want to estimate
potential short-term and/or acute effects, and because we are concerned about potential
confounding by seasonal trends---and have incorporated control for these trends in
our models---we often restrict these models to only look up to about a month following
exposure. However, this can help in identifying delayed effects of an exposure days to weeks
following the initial exposure, and can also help in determining the role of
mortality displacement in accounting for some or all of the excess deaths that are
associated with an exposure. While some environmental exposures of interest
have mostly immediate effects (e.g., hot temperature), others, including many air
pollutants, tend to have effects that are stretched over a longer period of one or
more days from exposure. As a result, distributed lag models are used widely in
environmental epidemiology studies of time series data, to ensure that important
associations aren't missed by limiting the model to focus on risk that are
detectable on the same day as the exposure. They can also help us identify influential
windows of exposure as well as help eliminate potential confoundign by exposures
occurring at proximal times to the window of interest. For example, today's exposure
may appear to have an effect on a helath outcome even if in reality yesterday's
exposure is the influential one and we don't control for it, because today's and
yesterday's exposure to temperature or air pollution are likely to be very similar.

To fit a distributed lag model, you can start with a fairly straightforward
extension of the regression models we've been fitting, especially if you are
investigating an exposure that can be plausibly fit with a linear term (rather than
a more complex non-linear basis function) in the regression model. Say you are starting,
for example, from the following regression model:

\[
log(E(Y)) = \alpha + \beta X + \mathbf{\gamma^{'}W} + ns(time)
\]

In this model, you are using a Poisson regression to investigate how risk of the
health outcome (\(Y\)) changes for every unit increase in the exposure (\(X\)), assuming
a linear relationship between the exposure and the log of the health outcome. The model
can include control for confounders like day of week (\(\mathbf{W}\)) and long-term and
seasonal time trends (\(ns(time)\)). This model should look familiar from some of the
models we've fit earlier to the example temperature data.

To expand this model to explore associations of temperature at different lags, the
simplest approach is to add a term for each lag---in other words, instead of only having
a term for temperature on the same day as the outcome measurement, we'll also include a
term for temperature the previous day, and the day before that, and so on. For example,
here's what the model would look like if we included terms up to lag 2:

\[
log(E(Y)) = \alpha + \beta_{0} X_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{2} + \mathbf{\gamma^{'}W} + ns(time)
\]
where \(X_0\) is temperature on the same day as the measured outcome \(Y\) (with an
associated coefficient \(\beta_0\)), \(X_1\) is the temperature the day before (with an
associated coefficient \(\beta_1\)), and \(X_2\) is the temperature two days before (with an
associated coefficient \(\beta_2\)). The interpretation of each of these coefficients
is similar---\(exp(\beta_2)\), for example, gives our estimate of the change in the relative
risk of the outcome \(Y\) for every one-unit increase in the exposure two days prior.

It can become cumbersome to write out the separate terms for each lag day, so you'll often
see equations for distributed lag models written using a shorter approach with the
\(\sum\) symbol. The \(\sum\) symbol expresses several terms that are added together and so
is well-suited for shortening the expression of a distributed lag model. For example, the
previous model equation could be rewritten as:

\[
log(E(Y)) = \alpha + \sum_{l=0}^2{\beta_lX_l} + \mathbf{\gamma^{'}W} + ns(time)
\]

This version of a distributed lag model is nice because it is fairly simple---we're taking the
idea of fitting a linear term for an exposure, and then expanding it to look include the
exposure on earlier days by adding the same type of term for exposure measured at each lag.
However, it does have some downsides. The main downside is that as we alluded to above, exposure
tends to be very strongly correlated from one day to the next. Any time you put different terms in a regression model that are correlated, you create the risk of \emph{collinearity}, and associated
problemswith fitting the model. The term \emph{collinearity} refers to the idea that you have two or more
columns in your model matrix that give identical (or, if you loosen the definition a bit,
very similar) information. To fit coefficients for each term, the modeling algorithm is trying
to identify weights to place on each column in the model matrix that result in a model that
gives the best likelihood of the data you see. If two or more columns have (almost) identical
information, then the algorithm struggles to determine how to define weight across these
two columns. The implications are that you can end up with a lot of instability in model
coefficients for the columns that are collinear, as well as very inflated estimates of the
standard error. Long story short, it can cause problems in your regression model if you include
independent variables that are very strongly correlated with each other, and so we usually
try to avoid doing that.

There are alternative distributed lag models that can help avoid this instability that can
arise from fitting a distributed lag by using a separate term for each lag. All of them share
a common feature---they somehow fit a function of the lags instead of each separate lag, so
that we end up adding fewer terms to the regression model (and, in term, are somewhat
constraining that pattern that the distributed lag effects follow). The most extreme
is to use a term that reduces all the lag terms to a single term, which you can do by
averaging the exposure across all lags. In other words, you could take the same-day
temperature, yesterday's temperature, and the temperature the day before that, and average
those three temperatures to create the term you put in the model. The model equation
in this case would look like:

\[
log(E(Y)) = \alpha + \beta_{\overline{0-2}} X_{\overline{0-2}} + \mathbf{\gamma^{'}W} + ns(time)
\]
where \(\overline{0-2}\) represents an average over lags 0 to 2, and so \(X_{\overline{0-2}}\)
is the average of the exposure on lags 0, 1, and 2 compared to the day that \(Y\) is
measured.

This approach avoids any issues with collinearity across exposure terms from different
lags, because you're only including a single term for exposure in the model. However,
there is a downside---this model will provide you with a single estimate for the
lagged effects, without allowing you to explore patterns across lags (for example,
is the association mostly on the day of exposure, or are there some delayed effects on
following days? the main assumption is that the effect is constant across all days in the
window of interest).

Another approach is more complex, but it allows you to explore patterns across lags.
Instead of reducing the lagged exposure to a single term in the model, you can reduce
it to a few terms that represent the basis for a smooth function. Often, a polynomial
or natural cubic spline function will be used for this. The details of setting up the
model become more complex, but fortunately there are software packages (like the \texttt{dlnm}
package in R) that help in managing this set-up, as we'll explore in the exercise.

Packages like \texttt{dlnm} can help in extending the complexity of the distributed lag model
in other ways, too. So far, we have explored using a distributed lag model where we
are happy to model the exposure using a linear term. As we've seen in earlier exercises,
this isn't ideal for temperature. Instead, temperature has a non-linear association
with mortality risk, with the lowest risk at mild temperatures and then increased risk
at both lower (colder) and higher (hotter) temperatures.

We can fit a GLM that incorporates the exposure using a non-linear shape while, at the
same time, including a non-linear function to describe how the association evolves
across lagged time following the exposure. The approach is to extend the idea of
using a basis function---instead of using a basis function in a single dimension, we'll
use cross of basis functions in two dimensions. One dimension is the level of exposure
(e.g., cold to hot temperatures), and the other is the timing between the exposure and
the outcome (e.g., same-day to lagged by many days). In terms of the mechanics of
building a model matrix to use to fit the regression model, everything follows directly
from the idea we explored early of using a function like a spline to create basis
variables in that model matrix for a term with a non-linear association with the
outcome variable. However, the mechanics do get quite cumbersome as so many terms are
included, and so again we will use the \texttt{dlnm} package to handle these mechanics as we
start to incorporate these cross-basis functions within a GLM.

\emph{Applied: Including a cross-basis function for exposure-lag-response in a GLM}

For this exercise, you will continue to build up the model that you began in
the examples in the previous chapter. The example uses the data provided with
one of this chapter's readings, \citet{vicedo2019hands}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Start with the simple model describing how are daily mortality counts are
  associated with a linear function of temperature. Include control for day of
  week and long-term / seasonal trends. Add to this model a term that describes
  the lagged effects of temperature up to a week following exposure, using a
  separate model term for each lag. What patterns do you detect in the lagged
  effects of temperature?
\item
  Start with the model from the first question, but change it to use a smooth
  function of lag to detect lagged effects, rather than fitting a seperate term
  for each lag. Extend the model to look at lagged effects up to a month following
  exposure. What patterns do you see in these lagged effects?
\item
  Refine your model to fit for a non-linear, rather than linear, function
  of temperature, while also incorporating a function to describe lagged effects up
  to a month following exposure. Based on this model, what does the association
  between temperature and mortality look like at lag 0 days? How about at lag 21 days?
  What does the pattern of lagged effects look like when comparing the relative risk of
  mortality at a hot temperature (e.g., 28 degrees C) to a milder temperature
  (7 degrees C)? What about when comparing mortality at a cold temperature
  (e.g., -4 degrees C) to a milder temperature (7 degrees C)? What is the
  cumulative relative risk at a hot temperature (e.g., 28 degrees C) to a
  milder temperature (7 degrees C), once you incorporated all lagged effects
  up to a month after exposure? If you use a constant term for the effect of exposure
  over a month as opposed to the smooth function you just used, how does the overall
  cumulative RR compare?
\item
  Assume that we are interested in the potential effect of a 5-day
  heatwave occurring on lags x to x? You can assess this as the effect of hot temperature
  (e.g., 28 degrees C) during these lags, while the temperature remains warm but more
  mild (e.g., 20 degrees C) the rest of the month, against constant 20 degrees C for
  the whole month. What is the effect under the `constant' model? How about the smooth
  function lag model?
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Applied exercise: Example code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Start with the simple model describing how are daily mortality counts are

\end{enumerate}

We'll start by looking at distributed lag associations by fitting a model with
separate terms for each of the lags we want to fit. Here, we want to fit up to
a week, so we'll want eight terms in total: ones for the same day (\(X_0\)), the
previous day (\(X_1\)), two days before (\(X_2\)), three days before (\(X_3\)),
four days before (\(X_4\)), five days before (\(X_5\)), six days before (\(X_6\)),
and seven days before (\(X_7\)).

Right now, our data have temperature lined up with the date of the recorded deaths:

## 6 1990-01-06   235  9.23
\end{verbatim}

To add lagged temperature to the model, then, we'll need to add some columns to our
data, so that the row for an observation includes not only the temperature on that
day, but also on each of the seven previous days. The \texttt{lag} function from the \texttt{tidyverse}
suite of packages can be used to create these columns:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{obs }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ obs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{tmean\_1 =} \FunctionTok{lag}\NormalTok{(tmean, }\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{), }
         \AttributeTok{tmean\_2 =} \FunctionTok{lag}\NormalTok{(tmean, }\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{), }
         \AttributeTok{tmean\_3 =} \FunctionTok{lag}\NormalTok{(tmean, }\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{), }
         \AttributeTok{tmean\_4 =} \FunctionTok{lag}\NormalTok{(tmean, }\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{), }
         \AttributeTok{tmean\_5 =} \FunctionTok{lag}\NormalTok{(tmean, }\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{), }
         \AttributeTok{tmean\_6 =} \FunctionTok{lag}\NormalTok{(tmean, }\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{), }
         \AttributeTok{tmean\_7 =} \FunctionTok{lag}\NormalTok{(tmean, }\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can see that each of these have taken \texttt{tmean} and then offset it by moving it down
by one or more rows (down one row for lag 1, two for lag 2, etc.). As a result, we now have
columns that give us today's temperature, yesterday's, and so on, all lined up with the
row with the observation for daily mortality:

You'll notice that this process has created some missing data right at the beginning of the
dataset---we don't know what the temperature was the day before Jan.~1, 1990, for example,
since the study data starts on Jan.~1, 1990. With most time series, we'll have plenty of
days in the study period, so we'll usually just allow these early dates to drop when the
model is fit.

Now we'll add all these terms to our regression model:

We can pull out all those estimates, calculate the 95\% confidence intervals (do this before
you take the exponential to get to the relative risk estimate!), and then exponentiate all
the terms to get estimates of relative risk of mortality per unit increase in temperature.

You can also use the \texttt{dlnm} package to fit this model, using the \texttt{crossbasis} function
to set up the distributed lag basis to include in the regression, and then the \texttt{crosspred}
function to extract results after fitting the regression model and to plot results.

First, you'll again use \texttt{crossbasis} to create the basis, as you did earlier when using this
package to fit a non-linear function of temperature. You will use the \texttt{lag} argument to say
the maximum lag you want to include---in this case, seven days (\texttt{lag\ =\ 7}). You can use
the \texttt{argvar} and \texttt{arglag} functions to specify the basis function for the exposure variable
and the distributed lag component. For right now, we'll use a very basic linear function for
the exposure (temperature), using \texttt{fun\ =\ "lin"} within the \texttt{argvar} list of arguments.
To fit a separate coefficient for each lag, we can specify \texttt{fun\ =\ "integer"} in the
\texttt{arglag} list of arguments (later we'll explore some other functions for the lag component).

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you take a peak at this crossbasis, you'll notice that it's doing something similar to
what we did when we added columns for lagged temperatures. The first column gives temperature
on the same day, the second on the previous day (and so is offset one down from the first
column), and so on. The crossbasis function deals with the missing early dates by setting
\emph{all} column values to be missing on those days; in practice, this difference in set up
won't create any difference in how the model is fit, as the \texttt{glm} function will by default
exclude any observations with \emph{any} columns of missing data.

You can proceed from here to plot estimates by lag using ggplot, but you can also use
some of the special functions for plotting in \texttt{dlnm}. We can plot the ``slice'' of comparing
the relative risk at 1 degree C (\texttt{var\ =\ 1}) (this will give us the one-unit increase,
because by default the crossbasis set-up with 0 degrees as the baseline, so this is
one degree above that value). The \texttt{crosspred} function predicts based on a crossbasis
and a regression model object that uses that crossbasis, then the \texttt{plot} function has a
special method for plotting the resulting crosspred object (to see the helpfile for this
plot method, type \texttt{?plot.crosspred} in your R console).

Next, we'll explore a model that constrains the lagged effects to follow a smooth
function, to help avoid this potential instability in the modeling.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Start with the model from the first question, but change it to use a smooth
  function of lag to detect lagged effects, rather than fitting a separate term
  for each lag. Extend the model to look at lagged effects up to a month following
  exposure. What patterns do you see in these lagged effects?}
\end{enumerate}

As a reminder, we can stabilize our model of lagged effects a bit by fitting the
lagged effects to be constrained to follow a smooth function, instead of fitting a separate
term for each lag. The \texttt{dlnm} package makes this very easy to do.

When you use \texttt{crossbasis} to set up a crossbasis function, you can make a lot of choices
to customize that crossbasis. The crossbasis combines a basis function for incorporating
the exposure in the regression model (temperature in this case), as well as a basis function
for incorporating lagged effects of that exposure. The \texttt{crossbasis} functions gives you
several choices for each of these basis functions for the two dimensions of the
crossbasis. Here, we'll look at using that flexibility for the lag dimension; in the next
part of the exercise, we'll add some more complexity in the basis function for the
exposure, as well.

To customize the basis function for lagged effects, you can use the \texttt{arglag} parameter
in the \texttt{crossbasis} function. You send this parameter a list of other parameters, which
get sent to a general \texttt{onebasis} function that builds that basis function (this will
be convenient when we start working with the exposure basis, too---you'll see that you
can use the same parameters in setting up each basis function).

To see the range of functions you can use for this crossbasis function, check the help
function for \texttt{onebasis}. When we fit a separate coefficient for each lag, we used the
``integer'' function, which creates a set of basis variables with indicators for each
separate lag (this is really similar to the idea of basis variables for a categorical
variable, like day of the week).

Here, we want to instead use a smooth function, with fewer degrees of freedom (i.e., fewer
columns created in the matrix of basis values). Two popular options for that function are
the ``poly'' function, which will fit a polynomial, or the ``ns'' function, which will fit
a natural cubic spline (just like we did earlier to create a non-linear function of
temperature). We'll use ``ns'' in this example (\texttt{fun\ =\ ns} in the list of parameters for
\texttt{arglag}).

For some of these functions, you'll need to specify additional parameters to clarify
how they should be built. For example, if you're using a spline, you need to specify
how many degrees of freedom it should have with \texttt{df}. We'll use 4 degrees of freedom,
but you can experiment with different values for this and see how it affects the shape
of the resulting function (i.e., the plot we create later). If you were fitting a
polynomial function,
you'd need to specify the degree of the polynomial; if you were fitting strata (i.e.,
constant values within sets of lags), you'd need to specify the breaks for dividing
those strata; if you were using a threshold function, you'd need to specify the threshold,
and so on. You can find more details on these options in the helpfile for \texttt{onebasis};
in general, the \texttt{onebasis} function is using other underlying functions like \texttt{ns} and
\texttt{poly} to build these functions, so the choice of parameters will depend on the parameters
for those underlying functions.

Here is the final call for building this new crossbasis (note that we're continuing to
use a linear function of temperature, and at this point still only looking at lags up to
a week; later in this question we'll expand to look at longer lags):

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If you look at this crossbasis object, you'll see that it's created a matrix of basis
variables, similar to the last part of the exercise. However, instead of having the same
number of columns as the number of lags (8), we now have fewer columns. We have 4, reflecting
the degrees of freedom we specified for the spline function of lag. Therefore, we've
constrained the lag function a bit compared to the previous part of the exercise. Again,
the values are all missing for the first seven days, since the data isn't able to capture
the lagged temperature for these days.

Again, once we build the crossbasis function, we can put it in the regression equation and
fit a regression model using \texttt{glm}:

Again, you can plot the results to see the pattern of associations by lag. The plot
is just visualizing the results of predicting the model to certain values. By default,
it will predict at each lag; this makes the plot a little ``jumpy'' if you're just looking
at lags for a week or so, so to make it smoother, you might want to ask \texttt{crosspred} to
predict to a finer resolution along the lag dimension (here, we're using \texttt{bylag\ =\ 0.2}).

You can go back to the \texttt{crossbasis} call and try playing around with the degrees of freedom
for the spline, to see how that affects the shape of this function. Be sure, though, that
you don't use more degrees of freedom than there are lags (i.e., more than 8).

Now let's try to extend the model out to look at up to a month after exposure. To do this,
all you need to do is change the \texttt{lag} argument in \texttt{crossbasis} to the longest lag you
want to include. Since we're adding more lags, you'll likely also want to increase the
degrees of freedom you use for the basis function of lag; here, I'm using 6, but you can
explore other values as well (again, don't use more than the number of lags, though).
From there, the process of fitting the model and plotting the results is identical.

  \textbf{Refine your model to fit for a non-linear, rather than linear, function
  of temperature, while also incorporating a function to describe lagged effects up
  to a month following exposure. Based on this model, what does the association
  between temperature and mortality look like at lag 0 days? How about at lag 21 days?
  What does the pattern of lagged effects look like when comparing the relative risk of
  mortality at a hot temperature (e.g., 28 degrees C) to a milder temperature
  (7 degrees C)? What about when comparing mortality at a cold temperature
  (e.g., -4 degrees C) to a milder temperature (7 degrees C)? What is the
  cumulative relative risk at a hot temperature (e.g., 28 degrees C) to a
  milder temperature (7 degrees C), once you incorporated all lagged effects
  up to a month after exposure?}
\end{enumerate}

To extend the model to include temperature using a non-linear function, we'll go back
to the \texttt{crossbasis} call, but this time we'll make some changes to the exposure variable
dimension. The basis function for the exposure is set using the \texttt{argvar} (``var'' is
for ``variable'') parameter. Again, this allows us to include a list of parameters that
will be passed to \texttt{onebasis} to build a basis function and set up basis variables for
this dimension of the crossbasis. We can use a spline for temperature by specifying
\texttt{fun\ =\ "ns"}, as well as specify the degrees of freedom for that spline (here, I've used
4, but again, feel free to experiment):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dl\_basis\_4 }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{crossbasis}\NormalTok{(obs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{tmean, }\AttributeTok{lag =} \DecValTok{30}\NormalTok{,}
                       \AttributeTok{argvar =} \FunctionTok{list}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{fun =} \StringTok{"ns"}\NormalTok{, }\AttributeTok{df =} \DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{), }

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Try looking at the crossbasis from this function (you'll need to look past the 30th row
or so, since the earliest rows will all be missing since they're in that range where
they don't have lag data available for the exposure). You can see that we now have a
\emph{lot} of columns: specifically, we have 4 (degrees of freedom for the temperature spline)
times 5 (degrees of freedom for the lag spline) = 20 columns.

The \texttt{dlnm} package has done
the work of setting up this crossbasis function, as well as creating this matrix of
basis variables from our original simple column of temperature measurements. This
is getting to be a much more complex function than the simple linear/unconstrained lag
function that we started with. However, the underlying principles and mechanics are the
same, they're just scaling up to allow some more complex ``shapes'' in our exposure-response
association.

Example datasets are available online, but also made available to you on the course
website. For the Framingham Heart Study the example data are available as the file
``frmgham2.csv''. It is saved in a csv format, and so they can be read into R using the
\texttt{read\_csv} function from the \texttt{readr} package (part of the tidyverse). You can use the following code to read in these data, assuming you have saved them in a ``data'' subdirectory of your current

  One important difference compared to a time-series dataset is the \texttt{RANDID} variable. This is the unique identifier for unit for which we have repeated observations for over time.
  In this case the \texttt{RANDID} variable represents a unique identifier for each study participant, with multiple observations (rows) per participant over time.
\item
  The \texttt{TIME} variable indicates the number of days that have ellapsed since beginning of follow-up of each observation. (\texttt{TIME=0} for the first observation of each participant).
\item
  Number of observations varies between participants (typical)
\item
  The time spacing between observations is not constant. This is because the repeated observations in the Framingham Heart Study are the result of follow-up exams happening 3 to 5 years apart. Many longitudinal cohorts will instead have observations over a fixed time interval (monthly, annual, biannual etc), resulting in a more balanced dataset.
\item
  Observations are given for various risk factors, covariates and cardiovascular outcomes. Some will be invariant for each participant over time (\texttt{SEX}, \texttt{educ}), while others will vary with each exam.
\end{itemize}

From a data management perspective, we might want to change all the column names
to be in lowercase, rather than uppercase. This will save our pinkies some
work as we code with the data! You can make that change with the following
code, using the \texttt{str\_to\_lower} function from the \texttt{stringr} package (part of
the \texttt{tidyverse}):

\emph{Applied exercise: Exploring longitudinal cohort data}
Read the example cohort data in R and explore it to answer the following
questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the number of participants and number of observations in the \texttt{fhs} dataset?
\item
  Is there any missingness in the data?
\item
  How many participants die? What is the distribution of age at time of death?
\item
  What is the distribution of age at time of incident MI? Are there differences between males and females? Are there differences in smoking between males and females?
\item
  What is the distribution of BMI among MI cases and non-cases? How about between smokers and non-smokers
\end{enumerate}

Based on this exploratory exercise in this section, talk about the potential
for confounding when these data are analyzed to estimate the association between
smoking and risk of incident MI.

\emph{Applied exercise: Example code}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{What is the number of participants and the number of observations in the \texttt{fhs} dataset? (i.e what is the sample size and number of person-time observations)}
\end{enumerate}

In the \texttt{fhs} dataset, the number of participants will be equal to the number of unique ID's (The \texttt{RANDID} variable which takes a unique value for each participant). We can extract this using the \texttt{unique} function nested within the \texttt{length} function

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{unique}\NormalTok{(fhs}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{randid))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4434
\end{verbatim}

If you'd like to use \texttt{tidyverse} tools to answer this question, you can do
that, as well. The pipe operator (\texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}) works on any type of object---it will
take your current output and include it as the first parameter value for the
function call you pipe into. If you want to perform operations on a column of
a dataframe, you can use \texttt{pull} to extract it from the dataframe as a vector, and
then pipe that into vector operations:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{pull}\NormalTok{(randid) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{unique}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{length}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 4434
\end{verbatim}

It's entirely a personal choice whether you use the \texttt{\$} operator and ``nesting''
of function calls, versus \texttt{pull} and piping to do a series of function calls.
You can see you get the same result, so it just comes down to the style that
you will find easiest to understand when you look at your code later.

The number of person-time observations will actually be equal to the length of the dataset.
The \texttt{dim} function gives us the length (number of rows) and width (number of columns) for a dataframe or any matrix like object in R.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{dim}\NormalTok{(fhs)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 11627    39
\end{verbatim}

We see that there is approximately an average of 2 to 3 observations per participants.

When you know there are repeated measurements, it can be helpful to explore
how much variation there is in the number of observations per study subject.
You could do that in this dataset with the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \CommentTok{\# Group by the study subject identifier and then count the rows for each}
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(randid) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{count}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \CommentTok{\# Reorder the dataset so the subjects with the most observations come first}
  \FunctionTok{arrange}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{desc}\NormalTok{(n)) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 6 x 2
## # Groups:   randid [6]
##   randid     n
##    <dbl> <int>
## 1   6238     3
## 2  11252     3
## 3  11263     3
## 4  12806     3
## 5  14367     3
## 6  16365     3
\end{verbatim}

You can visualize this, as well. A histogram is one good choice:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \CommentTok{\# Group by the study subject identifier and then count the rows for each}
  \FunctionTok{group\_by}\NormalTok{(randid) }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{count}\NormalTok{() }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
  \FunctionTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(}\FunctionTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{x =}\NormalTok{ n)) }\SpecialCharTok{+} 
  \FunctionTok{geom\_histogram}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-116-1.pdf}
All study subjects have between one and three measurements. Most of the study
subjects (over 3,000) have three measurements recorded in the dataset.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Is there any missingness in the data?}
\end{enumerate}

We can check for missingness in a number of ways. There are a couple of great
packages, \texttt{visdat} and \texttt{naniar}, that include functions for investigating
missingness in a dataset. If you don't have these installed, you can install
them using \texttt{install.packages("naniar")} and \texttt{install.packages("visdat")}. The
\texttt{naniar} package has \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naniar/vignettes/getting-started-w-naniar.html}{a vignette with
examples}
that is a nice starting point for working with both packages.

The \texttt{vis\_miss} function shows missingness in a dataset in a way that lets you
get a top-level snapshot:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(visdat)}
\FunctionTok{vis\_miss}\NormalTok{(fhs)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-117-1.pdf}
Another was to visualize this is with \texttt{gg\_miss\_var}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(naniar)}
\FunctionTok{gg\_miss\_var}\NormalTok{(fhs)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-118-1.pdf}

Many of the variables are available for all observations, with no missingness,
including records of the subject's ID, measures of death, stroke, CVD, and other
events, age, sex, and BMI. Some of the measured values from visits are missing
occasionally, like the total cholesterol, and glucose. Other measures asked of
the participants (number of cigarettes per day, education) are occasionally
missing. Two of the variables---\texttt{hdlc} and \texttt{ldlc}---are missing more often than
they are available.

You can also do faceting with the \texttt{gg\_miss\_var} function. For
example, you could see if missingness varies by the period of the observation:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{gg\_miss\_var}\NormalTok{(fhs, }\AttributeTok{facet =}\NormalTok{ period)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-119-1.pdf}

You may also want to check if missingness varies with whether an observation
was associated with death of the study subject:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{gg\_miss\_var}\NormalTok{(fhs, }\AttributeTok{facet =}\NormalTok{ death)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-120-1.pdf}

There are also functions in these packages that allow you to look at how
missingness is related across variables. For example, both \texttt{glucose} and
\texttt{totchol} are continuous variables, and both are occasionally missing. You
can use the geom function \texttt{geom\_miss\_point} from the \texttt{naniar} package
with a ggplot object to explore patterns of missingness among these two

The lower left corner shows the observations where both values are missing---it
looks like there aren't too many. For observations with one missing but not the
other (the points in red along the x- and y-axes), it looks like the distribution
across the non-missing variable is pretty similar to that for observations
with both measurements avaiable. In other words, \texttt{totchol} has a similar
distribution among observations where \texttt{glucose} is available as observations
where \texttt{glucose} is missing.

  \emph{How many participants die? What is the distribution of age at time of death?}
\end{enumerate}

The \texttt{death} variable in the \texttt{fhs} data is an indicator for mortality if a participant died at any point during follow-up. It is time-invariant taking the value 1 if a participant died at any point or 0 if they were alive at their end of follow-up, so we have to be careful on how to extract the actual number of deaths.

If you arrange by the random ID and look at \texttt{period} and \texttt{death} for each subject,
you can see that the \texttt{death} variable is the same for all periods for each
subject:

\end{verbatim}

We need to think some about this convention of recording the data when we count
the deaths.

It is often useful to extract the first (and sometimes last) observation, in order to assess certain covariate statistics on the individual level. We can create a dataset including only the first (or last) observation per participant from the \texttt{fhs} data using \texttt{tidyverse} tools. The \texttt{group\_by} functions groups data by unique values of designated variables (here \texttt{randid}) and the \texttt{slice} function selects rows as designated.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

  \FunctionTok{slice}\NormalTok{(1L)}\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}
  \FunctionTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Alternatively you can use the \texttt{slice\_head} function, which allows us to slice a designated number of rows beginning from the first observation. Because we are piping this in the \texttt{group\_by} function, we will be slicing rows beginning from the first observation for each \texttt{randid}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs\_first }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ fhs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

\FunctionTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can similarly select the last observation for each participant

\FunctionTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

or using the \texttt{slice\_tail} function

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs\_last }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{ fhs }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

\FunctionTok{ungroup}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In this dataset we can extract statistics on baseline covariates on the individual level, but also assess the number of participants with specific values, including \texttt{death=1}. For example, we can use the \texttt{sum} function in base R, which generates the sum of all values for a given vector. In this case since each death has the value of 1 the \texttt{sum} function will give as the number of deaths in the sample.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{sum}\NormalTok{(fhs\_first}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{death) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 1550
\end{verbatim}

Conversely using \texttt{tidyverse} tools we can extract the number of observations with \texttt{death=1} using the \texttt{count} function

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs\_first }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
\FunctionTok{count}\NormalTok{(death) }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 2 x 2
##   death     n
## * <dbl> <int>
## 1     0  2884
## 2     1  1550
\end{verbatim}

Note that survival or time-to-event outcomes in longitudinal cohort data will often be time-varying. For example, a variable for mortality will take the value of zero until the person-time observation that represents the time interval that the outcome actually happens in. For outcomes such as mortality this will typically be the last observation. We will construct a variable like this in \texttt{fhs} below.

In order to estimate the distribution of age at death among those participants who died during follow-up we need to create a new age at death variable. The \texttt{age} variable in \texttt{fhs} represents the participants age at each visit. Typically a death would happen between visits so the last recorded value for \texttt{age} would be less than the age at death. We will use the \texttt{timedth} variable to help us determine the actual age at death. The value of \texttt{timedth} is the number of days from beginning of follow-up until death for those with \texttt{death=1}, while it is a fixed value of \texttt{timedth=8766} (the maximum duration of follow-up) for those with \texttt{death=0}.

We can create a new age at death variable for those with \texttt{death=1} using the \texttt{age} at baseline and \texttt{timedth} values

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs\_first}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{fhs\_first }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can then get summary statistics on this new variable

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs\_first }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
\FunctionTok{summarize}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{min\_agedth =} \FunctionTok{min}\NormalTok{(agedth),}

\end{enumerate}

Similar to the question about death (all-cause mortality) we can look at disease incidence, for example myocardial infarction (MI). The \texttt{fhs} dataset has the \texttt{hospmi} variable as an indicator for any participant who had a hospitalization due to MI and \texttt{timemi} gives the number of days from beginning of follow up to the hospitalization due to MI. We can create an age at incident MI hospitalizaton in a similar fashion as the example for age at death.

We can see that the mean age at incident MI hospitalization among males and females is similar, but with males being somewhat younger on average at the time of incident MI. We can take a closer look at the distibution using boxplots:

\begin{Shaded}

  \FunctionTok{geom\_boxplot}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-136-1.pdf}
We see that R didn't return two separate boxplots by sex, but rather one centered between the two values of \texttt{sex=1} and \texttt{sex=2} which are the values for males and females respectively. This is an indicator that the sex variable is of class \texttt{numeric} and is treated as a continuous values rather than categorical. We can verify that this is in fact the case:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{class}\NormalTok{(fhs\_first}\SpecialCharTok{$}\NormalTok{sex)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "numeric"
\end{verbatim}

We can trasform the variable to one of class \texttt{factor} in order for it to be trated as a cateogrical variable

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fhs\_first}\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}}\NormalTok{fhs\_first }\SpecialCharTok{\%\textgreater{}\%} 
\FunctionTok{mutate}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{sex=}\FunctionTok{as.factor}\NormalTok{(sex))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we repeat the function for the boxplot now we get separate boxplots by sex

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

  \CommentTok{\# define the axes for the boxplot}

We can once again see from the the boxplots that females tend to be a little older at incidence of MI.

\section{Coding a survival analysis}\label{coding-a-survival-analysis}}

{[}R package \texttt{survival}{]}

In the context of survival analysis what is modelled is time to an event (also referred to as survival time or failure time). This is a bit different than the models in the linear or \texttt{glm} family that model an outcome that may follow a gaussian (linear regression), binomial (logistic model) or Poisson distribution. Another difference is that the outcome (time to event) will not be determined in some participants, as they will not have experienced the event of interest during their follow-up. These participants are considered `censored'. Censoring can occur in three ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item the participant does not experience the event of interest before the study end
\item the participant is lossed to follow-up before experiencing the event of interest
\item the participant experiences a difference event that makes the event of interest impossible (for example if the event of interest is acute MI a participants that dies from a different cause is considered censored)
\end{itemize}

These are all types of right censoring and in simple survival analysis they are considered to be uninformative (typically not related to exposure). If the censoring is related to the exposure and the outcome then adjustment for censoring has to happen.

Let's assume that we are interested in all cause mortality as the event of interest let's denote \(T\) is time to death and \(T\geq 0\). We define the survival function as
\(S(t)=Pr[T>t]=1-F(t)\), where the survival function \(S(t)\) is the probability that a participant survives past time \(t\) (\(Pr[T>t]=1\)). \(F(t)\) is the Probability Density Function, (sometimes also denoted as the the Cumulative Incidence Function, \(R(t)\)) or the probability that that an individual will have a survival time less than or equal to t (\([Pr(T≤t)]\))

Time to event \(t\) is bounded by \([0,\infty)\) and \(S(t)\) is non-increasing as \(t\) becomes greater. At \(t=0\), \(S(t)=1\) and conversely as \(t\) approaches \(\infty\), \(S(t)=0\). A property of the survival and probabilty density function is \(S(t) = 1 – F(t)\): the survival function and the probability density function (or cumulative incidence function (\(R(t)\)) sum to 1.

Another useful function is the hazard Function, \(h(t)\), which is the instantaneous potential of experiencing an event at time \(t\), conditional on having survived to that time (\(h(t)=\frac{Pr[t<T\leq t+\Delta t|T>t]}{\Delta t}=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\)). The cumulative Hazard Function, \(H(t)\) is defined as the integral of the hazard function from time \(0\) to time \(t\), which equals the area under the curve \(h(t)\) between time \(0\) and time \(t\) (\(H(t)=\int_{0}^{t}h(u)du\)).
If we know any of \(S(t)\), \(H(t)\) or \(h(t)\), we can derive the rest based on the following relationships:

\(h(t)=\frac{\partial log(S(t))}{\partial t}\)

\(H(t)=-log(S(t))\) and conversely \(S(t)=exp(-H(t))\)

The \texttt{survival} package in R allows us to fit these types of models, including a very popular model in survival analysis, the Cox proportional hazards model that was also applied in \citet{wong1989risk}. A very simple way to estimate survival is the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator.

In R we would estimate Survival \(S(t)\) with all-cause mortality representing failure as follows:

\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

The numbers assigned to each individual represent their censoring times, with each number with a plus sign indicating that the participant was censored at that times without developing the outcome (haven't failed/died), while those without the plus sign are the times at which participants developed the outcome (failure/death).

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-141-1.pdf}
We can see that as follow-up time increases survival decreases rather monotinacally over time, or in other words the number of people who have died increases. Survival \(\hat{S}(t)\) drops to about 0.65 at the end of follow-up, or in other words about 35\% of participants have died, which is what is expected as we already know that 1550 of 4434 participants have died.

We can repeat this estimation with a different time-scale of interest. Other that follow-up times we may also be interested in Survival and failure (mortality) with respect to age. We repeat the same code only changing the first argument in the \texttt{Surv} function, substituting time of death with respect to follow-up time with age at death.

\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics{adv_epi_analysis_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-142-1.pdf}
We see that the shape of this survival curve is different, with virtually no one dying until they reach their 40s, and then a sharper drop in survival as age increases.

The Cox proportional hazards model in a simple form has this form

\(log(\lambda(t|X))=log(\lambda_{0}(t))+\beta_{1}\times X\)

where \(\lambda(t)\) represent the hazard at time \(t\), \(\lambda_{0}(t)\) is the baseline hazard at time \(t\), and \(\beta_{1}\) is the log hazard for those with \(X=1\) compared to \(X=0\). The baseline hazard \(\lambda_{0}(t)\) is similar to the intercept term in a linear model or glm and is the value of the hazard when all covariates equal 0. However, unlike the intercept term in a linear model or glm, \(\lambda_{0}(t)\) is not estimated by the model.
The above model can also be writen as

\(\lambda(t|X)=\lambda_{0}(t)\times e^{\beta_{1}\times X}\)

\(e^{\beta_{1}}\) is the hazard ratio comparing those hose with \(X=1\) and \(X=0\)

Using the \texttt{fhs} data we will fit a simple Cox proportianal hazard for the effect of smoking on the hazard for MI.
